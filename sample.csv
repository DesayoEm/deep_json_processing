NCT07130435,"The Effect of Nursing Intervention Based on the Salutogenic Model on Sense of Coherence, Healthy Aging, and Quality of Life",,Ankara Yildirim Beyazıt University,OTHER,Ankara Yildirim Beyazıt University,OTHER,"The world population is rapidly aging, and Turkey is one of the countries where aging is occurring quickly. When the investigators examine the proportion of the elderly population to the total population over the years and decades, the invesitigators observe that the percentage was 3.9% in 1935, 3.4% in 1955, 4.1% in 1975, 5.7% in 2000, 7.2% in 2010, 7.7% in 2013, and 8.5% in 2017. Finally, in 2022, this proportion reached 9.9%. According to population projections, the proportion of the elderly population is expected to be 12.9% in 2030, 16.3% in 2040, 22.6% in 2060, and 25.6% in 2080 (TUIK, 2022).

The ability of elderly individuals to live independently is influenced by their social and economic conditions, physical health, as well as sociodemographic characteristics such as age and gender. The interaction of elderly individuals with society influences their healthy living behaviors. Furthermore, their interaction with personal and societal resources affects their sense of wholeness and quality of life. To achieve a good quality of life, elderly individuals need to use both internal and external resources, and education should support this (Tan et al., 2014). For health services to be effective, they must be sensitive to the differences, experiences, socioeconomic status, and cultural background of individuals. Therefore, health professionals, including nurses, should prioritize providing appropriate health services for elderly individuals during care (Temel et al., 2009). The roles of public health nurses in elderly health include providing education to elderly individuals and caregivers, offering counseling, protecting the health of elderly individuals, conducting physical assessments, teaching self-care and personal hygiene, making home visits when necessary, assessing and taking precautions regarding situations that could cause accidents, evaluating acute health problems and chronic diseases, educating about the management of chronic diseases, and implementing interventions based on nursing diagnoses (Akdemir et al., 2009). The most important principle in ensuring elderly individuals maintain their health and age healthily is to support them in acquiring basic living skills and independence as much as possible. These basic skills, also known as daily living activities, are crucial for preserving the quality of life by enabling elderly individuals to live independently. A review of the literature reveals that there is no evidence of educational or intervention programs aimed at supporting healthy aging for individuals aged 65 and over in Turkey, or programs that focus on holistic health. Therefore, this randomized controlled study will investigate

how an intervention and education program based on the salutogenic model affects elderly individuals' self-efficacy, healthy living behaviors, and coping skills with diseases and stressors. As a result, the applied intervention program will positively impact the quality of life, sense of wholeness, and healthy aging processes of elderly individuals by examining their responses to stressors and revealing the internal and external resources they can utilize.","The world population is rapidly aging, and Turkey is one of the countries where aging is occurring quickly.

The increase in the elderly population brings about various health, economic, social, and environmental challenges. In order to address these issues, societies are not only developing care and treatment methods for the elderly but are also giving importance to prevention methods. The ability to live independently is essential for healthy aging and maintaining a healthy population. To support the elderly in living independently, both preventive and therapeutic methods are used. This is because, alongside long life, the quality of life is also of great importance (Gürer et al., 2019). From the perspective of the National Action Plan on Aging, health problems emerge or existing issues are exacerbated with aging, thereby affecting living standards. In addition to the physical changes seen in this period, health problems related to chronic diseases also negatively impact the quality of life.

The increase in life expectancy at birth has contributed to the global increase in the elderly population (onikinciplan.sbb.gov.tr).

Adiponectin (ADPN) is inversely associated with body fat mass, and in healthy subjects, low ADPN is a predictor of mortality. Recently, higher rHuEPO dose itself is demonstrated to be associated with poor prognosis. So, in this study, we prospectively examined the relationship between rHuEPO dose, serum ADPN, and mortality in patients beginning HD.","We selected 85 patients (51 men/34 women, age; 64±15 years) who survived for more than 3 months after the start of HD.

NCT04445935,Anticoagulation in Patients Suffering From COVID-19 Disease-The Anti-Co Trial,,Hamad Medical Corporation,INDUSTRY,Hamad Medical Corporation,INDUSTRY,"Patients with COVID-19 associated ARDS and mechanical ventilation have a high mortality. Part of the disease is an activation of the coagulation system which seems to contribute to clotformation in the pulmonary bloodstream. Recently we implemented an algorithm applying higher doses of heparins (LMWH). However, this approach could not inhibit clotformation enough. Bivalirudin could prevent clotformation better and support dissolving existing clots.

Therefore, we want to compare 50 patients with the standard treatment with 50 patients under bivalirudin treatment which we normally apply in patients with a HIT-syndrome.

Our primary outcome measure is oxygenation reflected as P/F ratio.","The pandemic of COVID-19, a newly upcoming viral disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, puts the whole worlds health system under pressure.

Patients suffering from this disease mainly develop respiratory symptoms, which can lead to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) necessitating ICU admission in 10-20% of the cases admitted to hospital. In addition to these symptoms, patients show lymphopenia, cardiac symptoms and altered coagulation profiles. Although those patients are treated in the ICU the mortality there is more than 20% due to multiorgan failure.

One of the recent insights in this disease is its effect on the coagulation system. Meanwhile we know that the coagulation system gets activated. Furthermore, it seems that clot formation takes place in the pulmonary micro-vasculature which could contribute to the widely observed gas-exchange impairment. Therefore, many centers apply empiric anticoagulation for their COVID-patients. At the moment, we at HMC, also apply an empirical anticoagulation protocol as our standard approach. However, this is a symptomatic treatment without good proof.

Bivalirudin is a well-known agent which is used in HMC for cases in which anticoagulation is needed, but a contraindication for heparin exists (i.e. HIT syndrome). This drug has an interesting pharmacologic profile. It acts independent of antithrombin (AT), the physiological compound which enhances heparin effects under normal circumstances. This lack of dependence on AT, makes Bivalirudin an attractive choice in light of the contradictory reports on the levels of AT during COVID infection. If AT levels are decreased during the infection, heparin (as well as LMWH) cannot work efficiently, which would render our treatment less effective. Luckily, bivalirudin acts without the support of AT, so we could bypass this problem. In addition, bivalirudin has some fibrinolytic activities. It inhibits clot-bound thrombin which as a result destabilizes the clot rendering it more susceptible to thrombolysis. This property partially supports the dissolving of clots and could support re-opening the pulmonary microcirculation.

Objectives:

To prove the positive effect of anticoagulation with bivalirudin intravenously on gas-exchange in patients with COVID-19 and respiratory failure on invasive mechanical ventilation.",['Anticoagulation in COVID-19 ARDS'],['COVID-19' 'ARDS' 'Anticoagulation'],INTERVENTIONAL,,,This is a randomized controlled trial.,PARALLEL,,,TRIPLE,This study will be blinded to the above mentioned group.

NCT05491135,Hepatocytes Co-Encapsulated With Mesenchymal Stromal Cells in Alginate Microbeads for the Treatment of Acute Liver Failure in Paediatric Patients (HELP),HELP,King's College Hospital NHS Trust,OTHER,King's College Hospital NHS Trust,OTHER,"Acute Liver Failure in children is associated with high mortality without liver transplantation. In addition, donor organ shortage makes it difficult to provide this treatment to every potential patient. Liver transplantation is life-saving but it carries the risk of major surgery and complications from lifelong anti-rejection drugs to suppress the immune system. If bridged across the immediate crisis following acute liver failure, the immense regenerative potential of the liver means that the patient's own liver may 're-grow'. This period is very time sensitive. Unfortunately, if the vital synthetic and detoxification function of the liver is not provided, the patient will often die before the liver can re-grow.

Transplantation of liver cells (hepatocytes) can provide this 'bridge' with considerable advantages over whole organ transplantation. Firstly, hepatocytes are derived from donor livers which are otherwise unsuitable for transplantation. Secondly, unlike whole organs, they can be frozen and stored, thus act as an 'off the shelf' treatment. Thirdly, the technique of hepatocyte transplantation within microbeads coated with alginate (a gel originating from seaweed) and infused into the abdominal cavity is much less invasive than liver transplantation. Finally, the alginate protects the cells against the body's immune system, avoiding the need for immunosuppressive drugs and the associated major risks. Furthermore, preclinical work in King's College Hospital has shown that the addition of support cells called mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), can significantly improve the ability of hepatocytes to survive and function within the alginate microbead.

The HELP trial is a Phase 1/2 safety and tolerability study of infusion of HMB002 (an optimal combination of hepatocytes and mesenchymal stromal cells put together in peptide-alginate microbeads) into paediatric patients with acute liver failure. This novel cellular therapy may act as a bridge treatment to liver transplant or lead to regeneration of the native liver.","This is an open label, single centre study first in man study. The study will be conducted using the Simon two stage design. Nine patients will be recruited during stage 1 of the study. Once 9 patients have completed their 24 weeks visit, the study will stop for futility if only 2 or fewer patients have survived with the native liver. Otherwise, the study will progress to Stage 2 of recruitment, where the trial will continue to enroll a further 8 patients. A total of 17 patients will be recruited into the study (at the end of stages 1 and 2). At the end of the second stage, 7 or more patients out of the 17 enrolled should have survived with the native liver at 24 weeks post HMB002 treatment, to show evidence of efficacy of this novel hepatocyte transplantation that would support a larger randomised controlled trial.

Following signed informed consent from parent/legal guardian, the following screening tests and procedures will be undertaken to ensure patient is eligible to take part in the study (some of these may be part of routine care).

* Medical and Medication History
* Physical examination
* Height and weight monitoring
* Vital signs (body temperature, blood pressure, Pulse rate and Oxygen saturation)
* Urine or serum pregnancy test in females of childbearing potential
* Clinical blood tests and additional research bloods
* Recording of neurological parameters
* Ultrasound of the abdomen
* Quality of Life - Parent and where appropriate patient questionnaires (optional)

Enrolled participants will have pre-infusion checks and monitoring in the paediatric high dependency unit (HDU) or Paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Children with acute liver failure generally require this degree of monitoring in any case. The child may be intubated and ventilated as part of routine care. This involves ventilation using a machine to help move air into and out of the lungs. If a suitable donor liver becomes available within 12 hours of planned study treatment, patient will go onto receive a liver transplant.

Following successful pre-infusion checks, the solution containing beads will be infused manually into the peritoneal cavity with usually a 50ml syringe, as a single infusion or several infusions, to achieve in excess of 25 million hepatocytes per kilogram of the body weight. HMB002 infusion will be done under ultrasound guidance.

* Participants will be continuously monitored before and for at least 24 hours after infusion in PICU/HDU. Some of these tests outlined below will be as per HDU and PICU standard of care. Once clinical condition permits and after 24 hours post infusion, the child may be stepped down to the paediatric wards.

  * Physical and neurological examination
  * Intra-abdominal pressure will be measured using urinary catheter where possible, at regular intervals both before and after infusion.
  * Regular review of the IMP infusion site
  * regular Vital signs (body temperature, blood pressure, Pulse rate and Oxygen saturation) • Clinical bloods at regular intervals both pre and post infusion.
  * Additional research bloods
  * Recording of ventilator settings and additional supportive therapy given as part of standard of care • Ultrasound of the abdomen
  * Recording of side effects
  * Recording of change in medications
* Participants will undergo daily examination until Day 7 while still an inpatient, and then be followed up at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24 and 52. Participants will be discharged following a liver organ transplant or upon recovery of their native liver. Therefore some of the follow up visits will be done in the outpatient clinics at King's College Hospital. Patients will have some or all of the assessments below at each follow up visit. Some of these visits will be part of standard routine care.

  * Physical and neurological examination
  * Height and weight monitoring,
  * Monitoring of Vital signs (body temperature, blood pressure, Pulse rate and Oxygen saturation)

  * Recording of changes to Medication
  * Parent and where appropriate patient questionnaires at final visit (optional parents/legal guardian consent
  * Ultrasound of the abdomen at specified time points in the protocol.

Microbeads will ideally be removed within 4 weeks of infusion. This will be done at the time of liver transplant or upon recovery of the native liver prior to discharge (using laparoscopy, a small key hole surgery of the abdomen).

Participants will also be followed up for another 9 years after HMB0002 infusion for monitoring of long term safety. This will be aligned with routine care and will be conducted annually as a minimum but may be more frequent depending on the clinical condition of the child or young person.

Subjects allocated to the BFR group will undergo BFRT, while control group will undergo standard-of-care ACLR rehabilitation, 2 days per week for 16 weeks. Measurements of strength, quality of life, and overall function will be completed at regular intervals.","Background:

Approximately 100,000 anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions (ACLR) are performed yearly, and rates of these surgeries in patients younger than 15 years increased by 924% between 1990 and 2007.1 Persistent strength deficits in quadriceps musculature following ACLR are common, even several months after surgery and despite targeted physical therapy to address atrophy.2 Quadriceps atrophy and weakness are associated with worse patient-reported outcomes (PROs),3 as well as altered movement strategies and increased risk of reinjury.4,6 Approximately 20% of teenagers returning to sports will sustain a second ACL injury in the first two years following their ACLR.5 Regaining neuromuscular activation and strength of the quadriceps muscle safely and efficiently is vital to full recovery, and current post-operative physical therapy regimens have not sufficiently addressed this impairment.

Strength training models recommend utilizing high resistance workloads to produce substantial strength gains,7 yet those recovering from orthopedic surgery are unable to tolerate heavy loads.8 Supplementing low-load resistance training with blood flow restriction (BFR-LLT) produces significant muscle hypertrophy and strength gains previously only thought to be achievable with high-load resistance training.9 BFR-LLT uses a tourniquet around the leg (see Appendix 4) to partially occlude venous return and decrease blood supply to the muscle being exercised. The generation of a low-oxygen environment and increases in plasma growth hormone levels has been shown to promote recruitment of motor units, improve neuromuscular activation, and result in muscular hypertrophy and growth.10-13 In adults and the elderly, improvements in quadriceps strength have been reported in up to 19%14 and increased quadriceps cross-sectional area in up to 6-7% compared to controls.15-16 To date there have only been four high-level studies investigating effects of BFR training in patients following ACLR17-20 and limited conclusions can be drawn from these studies due to lack of consistent methodology (variable cuff pressures and treatment frequency). More high-quality research is needed to determine treatment parameters that produce the most optimal results from this intervention in ACLR patients.

Additionally, there are no published randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of BFR training on exclusively adolescent patients. All high-quality BFR training research in patients following knee surgery have been conducted in late adolescent, young adult and adult populations.17-21 Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess the effect of BFR-LLT on quadriceps strength and outcomes in adolescents following ACLR.

This study's adolescent-specific focus provides a significant contribution to ACLR research, as younger patients demonstrate higher risk of reinjury.22-24 The results from this preliminary study will ultimately provide data to guide clinicians in optimizing quadriceps strength and utilizing BFR-LLT in younger post-operative ACLR patients.

Protocol:

This randomized clinical trial is an interdisciplinary project between the CHOA Sports Medicine Physical Therapy department and Children's Physician Group (CPG) Orthopedics. As part of standard-of-care, all patients who plan to undergo ACLR by CPG Orthopedics surgeons are referred for at least one PT visit pre-surgery, at which time baseline strength measurements are obtained by the treating physical therapist. Pre-surgery collection of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) is also standard of care for all patients undergoing ACLR.

Skeletally mature male and female adolescents with closed growth plates documented by radiograph who undergo ACLR with quadriceps tendon autograft will be screened by a physical therapist (the PI or co-investigators) using medical notes.

If a patient meets criteria and consents, he/she will be enrolled into the study during the first routine-of-care post-surgery PT visit and randomized to undergo standard post-surgery rehabilitation (control group) or standard post-surgery rehabilitation with supplemental BFR-LLT (test group) as demonstrated in Figure 1 and Appendix 1. Participants will be randomized using a computer program that will generate random numbers to assign participants to the test group or the control group. Participants will be asked to complete four PROs throughout the study (Lysholm, Pedi-IKDC, ACL-RSI, and AMCaMP - see Appendix 5.1-5.4). All relevant demographic, physiological, and radiographic data will be collected at the time of enrollment via RedCap, through a secure link. Data will be stored in a password-protected file on a secure Children's server and only the PI, Co-investigators, and research coordinator will have access.

Eight physical therapists (all CITI-trained) at four sports medicine PT sites will oversee all post-surgery PT sessions. Participants in the control group will follow a standard post-surgery rehabilitation protocol starting 2-5 days post-surgery and attend two PT visits per week until 16 weeks post-surgery. The test group will follow an identical schedule of PT visits but will have two to three exercises in each session supplemented with BFR treatment using the Delfi Personalized Tourniquet System (PTS). Requirements of BFR treatment are described below. For both groups, each session will last approximately 60 minutes. Each of the exercises performed with BFR will last 5-18 minutes, with total time under occlusion not exceeding 30 minutes per visit.

Participants undergoing BFR treatment will wear limb protection sleeves designed to help protect the skin beneath the cuff while the cuff is pressurized. Skin integrity will be monitored pre- and post-treatment at each session. If a study participant reports intolerable pain levels during BFR, the physical therapist will fully deflate the cuff and BFR treatment will cease for that PT session. Any adverse events will be reported to the PI and Co-I's within 24 hours. All required medical assessments will be promptly performed.

If a participant is assigned to the test group, BFR intervention will end after 16 weeks post-surgery. Both the test group (BFR-LLT) and the control group will follow standard of care treatment after week 16 post-surgery, including the standard post-intervention functional testing at 24 weeks post-surgery.

Participants will be asked to complete PROs periodically throughout the study as listed below under data collection. All physical examination measures and testing listed are standard of care for ACLR rehabilitation patients. Details on the regimen followed by both cohorts during the full 6-month rehabilitation are outlined in Appendix 1.

BFR-LLT Treatment Requirements:

The BFR-LLT intervention requires participants to follow the two requirements listed below, as the treatment parameter of 80% LOP has been widely recommended as the ideal amount of blood flow occlusion throughout the literature. Participants who do not meet these criteria will be excluded from the study but will continue to receive standard of care for post-surgery ACLR rehabilitation.

1. Tolerate a personalized pressure of 80% of the limb occlusion pressure (LOP) for 100% of all physical therapy visits in which BFR-LLT is utilized.
2. Tolerate BFR-LLT for a minimum of 20 visits over 16 weeks.

Data Collection:

1. Demographic data (pre-surgery, which is standard of care) will include age, gender, race/ethnicity, height/weight, physeal status, and assessment of baseline activity level with the Tegner Activity Scale (see Appendix 6)
2. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) (see Appendix 5) will include the Pediatric Internal Knee Documentation Committee (Pedi-IKDC, Appendix 5.1), Lysholm Score (Appendix 5.2), ACL-Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) confidence assessment (Appendix 5.3) and Adolescent Measure of Confidence and Musculoskeletal Performance (AMCaMP,Appendix 5.4). These PROs are collected pre-surgery as standard of care, but further collection and reassessment of PROs as described in Figure 2 will be unique to study participants. Surveys will be collected and recorded on iPads with direct entry into REDCap and in each participant's confidential EHR on the treatment note from the day the data was collected. All responses will be stored on a secure RedCap server through a secure link and data will be stored in a password-protected file on a secure Children's server. Only the PI and Co-I's will have access to the data.",['Anterior Cruciate Ligament Rupture'],"['Adolescents' 'Blood Flow Restriction Training'

NCT02583035,Telephone OncoGériatric Followed in the Management of Elderly Patients Treated for Cancer or Haematological Malignancy,TelOG,Centre Francois Baclesse,OTHER,Centre Francois Baclesse,OTHER,"There are no recommendations and few studies on the monitoring of fragile patients in the oncological treatment, both on the organizational arrangements on its interest in the prevention of functional deterioration of the patient and adaptation of the potential cancer treatment.

The oncogériatrique evaluation being time-consuming, requiring the movement of these more or less frail elderly patients, it seems difficult to envisage repeated and systematic standardized geriatric assessments during cancer treatment. Geriatric fragility can be detected by telephone. Craven et al. has already assessed the telephone follow-up by a nurse in patients treated for cancer, but with the aim to detect toxicities of cancer treatment, patients are not very old (mean age 64.8 years).

External evaluation by the nurse coordinator of UCOG (Coordination Unit in geriatric oncology) not knowing the patients included avoids bias of subjectivity in the interrogation.

However the telephone monitoring, with the aim to evaluate the evolution of geriatric frailty, has not been specifically studied in the elderly population treated for cancer, while taking oncology load.
