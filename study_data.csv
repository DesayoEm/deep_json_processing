6a9bb238f39ba1ea,NCT00998335,Effect of a Basal/Pre-Meal Insulin Strategy (Detemir/Aspart) on Insulin Secretion and Action in Type 2 Diabetes,Effect of a Basal/Pre-Meal Insulin Strategy (Detemir/Aspart) to Improve Insulin Secretion and Action in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes,,20060167,"The optimal insulin therapy in T2DM is controversial and its impact on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has not been systematically studied before, and in particular, never when using the new insulin formulations detemir (Levemir®) or aspart (Novolog®). This study is to determine the effect on hepatic steatosis and insulin secretion/action of lowering the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) to target with once daily basal insulin detemir alone or combining insulin detemir with premeal insulin aspart in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

In the first 3 months the investigators will optimize metabolic control in all patients with intensive basal (bedtime) detemir insulin aiming at a normal fasting plasma glucose. After this treatment period, patients will be randomized in the second 3 months in a 2:1 ratio to insulin detemir or detemir plus aspart. The investigators propose that insulin will improve day-long glycemic control and A1c, reduce hepatic steatosis (NAFLD) (primary endpoint) and insulin secretion/sensitivity being well tolerated while causing minimal weight gain and hypoglycemia (secondary endpoints). The study will allow to assess if there is an additional benefit of adding pre-meal rapid-acting insulin aspart to basal insulin to these endpoints.","The control of hyperglycemia in T2DM ameliorates the metabolic abnormalities of T2DM but whether this improves hepatic steatosis has not been examined carefully with the use of improved insulin formulations (long-acting insulins detemir or glargine, alone or combined with pre-meal short-acting insulins). Most research studies have focused on glycemic control without a careful examination to the underlying mechanisms, with some of these studies reporting on improved hepatic and muscle insulin sensitivity. The investigators have found in the laboratory that intensified insulin therapy in T2DM is associated with enhanced glycogen synthase fractional velocity and non-oxidative glucose disposal, but with no improvement at the level of insulin-stimulated insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, hexokinase II mRNA or enzyme function, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) associated with IRS-1, or Akt phosphorylation. Our work did not examine hepatic steatosis or insulin secretion/action, nor was designed to distinguish between the relative contribution of reduced glucotoxicity on insulin sensitivity vs. beta-cell function from pre-meal regular vs. NPH insulin. It is possible that the beneficial effects of insulin therapy of reduced plasma glucose and FFA concentrations may be offset by excessive hyperinsulinemia and weight gain from the use of insulins with suboptimal pharmacokinetics compared to the newer insulin formulations.

Insulin detemir is an insulin analogue approved in 2005 by the FDA. It is a long-acting insulin analogue that has shown to be more predictable in achieving therapeutic plasma insulin levels compared to NPH insulin. This is associated with several clinical benefits, such as better glycemic control, less hypoglycemia, modest weight gain and better quality of life for patients with type 2 diabetes. If gluco-lipotoxicity likely play an important role in the development of hepatic steatosis (NAFLD) in T2DM the investigators speculate that if reversed by a strategy of basal long-acting insulin (insulin detemir) alone, or combined with a rapid-acting analog (pre-meal insulin aspart) may be a good strategy for the treatment of T2DM.",University of Florida,OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,30.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,TREATMENT,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Relative sex-steroid deprivation accentuates GH and IGF-I depletion, since Te stimulates GH and IGF-I production in older men, hypogonadal males of all ages, and patients undergoing (genotypic female-to-male) gender reassignment. Tamoxifen blocks this effect of Te, suggesting involvement of E2 in GH's stimulation in men. E2 per se stimulates GH secretion in women. Because Te is converted to E2 by aromatization in the body, we postulate that E2 is the active moiety in men also. Moreover, we hypothesize that the decline of E2 in older men contributes to the fall in GH output. This has never been tested. From a clinical vantage, understanding the mechanistic basis of Te's drive of the somatotropic axis is especially relevant in boys with pubertal failure, adults with primary hypogonadism and men with aging-related hypoandrogenemia. In relation to aging in the male, testosterone and E2 bioavailabilities fall by 35-50% in the eighth compared with third decade of life. From a medical perspective, aging is accompanied by progressive osteopenia, sarcopenia and intra-abdominal obesity. These adverse outcomes are remediable by short-term replacement with Te and/or recombinant GH, thus linking GH/Te/E2 availability with key body-compositional features.",Mayo Clinic,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,43.0,RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,,BASIC_SCIENCE,,,TRIPLE,,,"Inclusion:

Approximately 75% of epithelial ovarian cancers are detected at an advanced stage. Metastasis and spread are mostly through transperitoneal planting and neighborhood by shedding from the ovarian surface. Metastasis mostly occurs in the peritoneum, omentum, and intestines. The rectosigmoid colon is the main part of the intestine affected by metastasis due to its neighborhood.

Treatment in ovarian cancer consists of a combination of cytoreduction surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy. Surgery is the basis of the treatment, and the main goal is to achieve no residual visible tumor (complete cytoreduction: R0). The residual tumor is one of the main factors affecting survival and reflects the possibilities of the surgical center and the team. Multiple surgical procedures (total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, total omentectomy, peritonectomy, retroperitoneal lymphadenectomies such as pelvic and paraaortic, bowel resections, splenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, various resections related to the bladder, liver, stomach, and diaphragm) may be required to achieve complete or optimal cytoreduction.

In the involvement of the rectosigmoid colon, primarily the serosa, then the muscular layer and finally the mucosa are infiltrated due to the nature of the spread, and therefore most of the involvement is observed in the seromuscular layer. In seromuscular infiltration, resection of the rectosigmoid colon or shaving of tumoral implants without resection can be performed. There are advantages and disadvantages of each method in terms of morbidity.

Previous studies have established the ability of rt-PA to lyse venous thrombus in patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and suggest that successful rt-PA mediated thrombolysis can prevent the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), a morbid, late complication of DVT that occurs in nearly 50% of patients.

rt-PA is delivered directly into venous thrombus using a catheter/device which is embedded within the thrombus by a physician under imaging guidance. This method of rt-PA delivery, pharmacomechanical catheter-directed intrathrombus thrombolysis (PCDT),is thought to be safer, more effective, and more efficient than previous methods. The question of whether PCDT using rt-PA improves long-term DVT patient outcomes with acceptable risk and cost has not yet been addressed.

The rationale for performing the ATTRACT Trial is based upon:

* the major burden of PTS on DVT patients and the U.S. healthcare system
* the association between rapid clot lysis and prevention of PTS
* the proven ability of rt-PA to dissolve venous thrombus in proximal DVT

8a561a343a8bbfb1,NCT00123708,Hypertonia in Patients With Cerebral Palsy,Hypertonia in Patients With Cerebral Palsy,,050204,"This study will classify types of hypertonia in patients with cerebral palsy and determine if the classifications are reasonable in relation to the functional task of walking. Hypertonia is an abnormal increase in muscle tension. It is a common symptom of cerebral palsy that can lead to loss of function and deformity. This study may help scientists improve evaluation criteria for hypertonia and, ultimately, treatment results.

Patients with cerebral palsy who are older than 6 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and clinical evaluation.

Participants are asked to walk in the lab while cameras record their movement. During this test, subjects wear a t-shirt and shorts with their arms and legs wrapped with a soft, rubber-like material. A piece of firm material is attached to the rubber sleeves and small plastic reflective balls are attached to the firm material. Balls may also be attached to the skin, using an adhesive. With the balls in place, the subject walks several times while cameras record the positions of the balls. In addition, small metal electrodes attached to the skin with an adhesive measure the electrical activity in the muscles.

After the walking test is completed, subjects' leg muscle strength is measured with a special device while they perform three activities. First, they sit on a special chair with their leg and foot placed in an apparatus that measures their strength, then lie on their back, then on their stomach, and then stand on one foot holding a bar to balance during part of one activity. During the activities, their reflexes are tested, they are asked to move their legs, and their legs are moved for them.","Cerebral palsy (CP) affects 0.25% of newborn babies in the U.S. alone each year. Hypertonia (increased joint resistance to externally imposed motion) is a common symptom that limits function in this patient population. It may originate in spasticity, dystonia or rigidity or may be a combination of all these factors. Surgical, rehabilitation and pharmacotherapeutic methods are used to improve functional outcome in patients with cerebral palsy. These treatments are not always effective, and the amount of improvement is difficult to predict. The choice of treatment is based on clinical tests that are not objective, especially in children, and they do not allow for differentiation between various causes of increased joint resistance. As a result, ineffective treatments are offered to patients with different types of movement disorders. The complex torque devices used in research facilities to quantify the resistance of a joint cannot be easily applied in clinical settings. In previous studies, a portable measurement method was developed based on a hand-held force transducer, which allowed for the quantification of biomechanical and bioelectrical characteristics of resistance of a knee joint at different velocities. Using this method, we found different types of hypertonia that had not been previously reported in patients with cerebral palsy. It is not clear to what degree hypertonia restricts an ability to execute selected functional tasks, due in part to the considerable variability in patients with CP. If this variability could be decreased, the relationship between restricted ability and the different types of hypertonia would be easier to determine. Strong arguments exist to consider different pathophysiologies in these different types of hypertonia.

The aim of this non-invasive study is to sub-classify patients with CP based on the type of knee hypertonia, and to determine if the classification is valid during the functional tasks of walking. When validated, it can serve as a predictive model for the relationship between the clinical evaluation at bedside and functional outcome.

To classify hypertonia, the resistance of a knee joint at different velocities in knee flexion and extension and the maximum activation of stretched and shortened muscles are measured with a hand-held force transducer, an electrogoniometer, and surface electrodes in 100 patients with CP. The strength of velocity-dependent hypertonia during passive stretch and position, and/or velocity thresholds will be calculated. The knee extension and flexion muscles will be classified bilaterally as normal, or as one of the four types based on the pattern of activation of stretched muscles. To determine the impact of other impairments on the function, the maximum isometric knee flexion and extension strength and the monosynaptic reflexes of the rectus femoris muscle will be measured.

At the functional level, we will evaluate knee motion during walking. To determine the impact of hypertonia on function, the Spearman R correlation will be used to analyze data in patients within the same class. To determine if the classification holds during walking, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient will be calculated. The significance of differences will be tested at the level of significance alpha less than or equal to 0.05.

It is expected that as a result of this study, better criteria for classifying patients into predictable categories correlated to specific therapeutic responses will be established.

Data on quality of life, abdominal pain, gallstone disease, and patient characteristics will be collected before surgery. The outcomes will be assessed three months following surgery and will primarily be determinants for resolution of pain. The aim is to make a prediction score that may aid clinicians and patients in decision making about surgery.","Cholecystectomy is the surgical removal of the gallbladder and the only definitive treatment for both symptomatic complicated and uncomplicated gallstones. Surgery rates for laparoscopic cholecystectomy have been rapidly rising in European countries the past decades. Over 9000 cholecystectomies were performed in Denmark in 2016. Symptomatic outcomes following surgery have not been with the intended resolution of symptoms and remaining symptoms are reported in about 35% of patients. This indicates clinical challenges in selecting the patients that will benefit the most from surgery.

The quality of symptomatic outcomes following laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be assessed in a Danish population reflecting current clinical practice for selection of patients with symptomatic uncomplicated gallstones for surgery. Development of a clinical prediction tool for pain relief including both patient-reported and readily available objective variables could aid future patient selection and minimize overall health-care costs and unnecessary surgery risk in patients with symptomatic uncomplicated gallstones.

The aim is to perform a prospective assessment of the symptomatic outcomes of elective laparoscopic intended cholecystectomy in patients with symptomatic uncomplicated gallstones and to develop a prediction model for a pain-free state.

This is a prospective observational study that will be performed across the general surgical hospitals in healthcare regions of Denmark. Consecutive consenting patients will be included from each site until required sample size has reached.

Eligible patients will be identified through screening lists of outpatient clinics and of operating theaters. Patients will be approached for consent and data collection at either the outpatient clinical visit where cholecystectomy is scheduled or at a later timepoint before surgery. Follow-up for symptomatic outcome will be performed three months after surgery. Data collection at both study entry and follow-up will include access to the electronic patient record and answering an online patient questionnaire. If patient questionnaires remain unanswered after one week, the patient will be reminded through an online re-invitation. Data collection at entry will also include the patients' medical history and clinicopathological variables. Data will be stored in a purpose-build database in the clinical research platform REDCap.

The study will be run by a steering committee including senior surgeons acting as local investigators from each of the participating centers. The local investigator will ensure completion of data forms and follow-up procedures. An additional collaborator from each center may further be appointed responsible for patient identification and data collection.

This study is purely observational and no alterations to standard patient treatment will be performed.

A prediction model with high internal and external validity requires model development and validation to be performed in two independent sets of data. To ensure this, half of patients will be included for model development and the other half for model validation.

Based on a previous report, 60% (57%) will become pain-free following cholecystectomy. With a prediction model containing up to 12 exposure variables and a parameter to outcome event ratio of 1:20, the required sample size is 400 patients for model development. The total sample size will be 800 patients for both development and validation of the model. It is estimated that each center will identify about 20 eligible patients each month and the required inclusion period is therefore about two to three years.

Previous studies of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) intake have shown beneficial actions on a range of human health conditions. The influence of n-3 PUFAs on cognition throughout the lifespan is particularly apparent, with beneficial effects documented on cognitive development in infants and children, cognitive performance in young adults, and to slow age-related cognitive impairment in older adults. Despite these positive findings, there has been little consideration of the influence of n-3-PUFAs on cognition in adolescence. Adolescence is characterized by profound brain development, with brain areas such as the prefrontal cortex continuing to mature into the late twenties). In this period of brain development, the basis is laid for executive functions (e.g., shifting, updating, and short-term memory), among others. Optimal development of the prefrontal cortex is very important, as the executive functions have been related to academic achievements. The positive effects from n-3 PUFAs on cognition, if translated to adolescents, would be of clear practical and theoretical importance, particularly in an academic context.

￼

This project will examine the relationship between supplementation with a commercially available, plant-derived, omega-3 intervention and cognitive performance in adolescent participants aged 13-14 years. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group clinical trial, we will examine the effect of 16 weeks repeated daily dosing of Juice PLUS+® OMEGA (or matched placebo) on a wide range of cognitive processes (measured using a battery of computer-based cognitive tests).

At an initial screening visit, participants will practice the cognitive tests and provide a 3-day food diary as a measure of habitual diet. Participants will then attend a baseline test visit, where they will perform the cognitive tests and receive a 16-week supply of capsules (either placebo or active treatment) to be taken daily.

Hypercalciuria can be secondary to increased intestinal absorption and/or increased renal distal tubular reabsorption of calcium due to increased active vitamin D, i.e. 1,25(OH)2D, levels. The management of hypercalciuria is challenging. Classic management based on hyperhydration and dietary advice has low impact on calciuria and therefore on CKD progression. Other strategies such as hydrochlorothiazide can be proposed, however with an uncertain medical benefit in view of side effects (hypokalemia, asthenia, potential cutaneous long-term side effects).

Azoles are known to inhibit the 1α-hydroxylase and therefore decrease 1,25(OH)2D levels. These antifungal drugs are commonly used in neonates, infants and adults; pharmacokinetic data are well described. Recently, to improve azoles tolerance, fluconazole has been successfully reported to reduce calciuria in patients with CYP24A1 mutation (1 adult) or NPTIIc mutations (1 child), while maintaining a stable renal function. Based on these observations, the investigators hypothesize that fluconazole is effective to decrease and normalize calciuria in patients with hypercalciuria and increased 1,25(OH)2D levels.

The primary objective is to demonstrate that fluconazole normalizes or decreases calciuria after 18 weeks of treatment in patients with hypercalciuria and increased 1,25(OH)2D levels.

The secondary objectives aim to describe:

* the effects of fluconazole on the evolution over time of the calcium/phosphate metabolism,
* the evolution of renal function,
* the cohort at Baseline and after 4 months of treatment period,
* the safety of fluconazole,
* the onset of potential mycological resistances,

A total of approximately 250 patients will be assessed to identify clinical, laboratory, and operative factors associated with postoperative fever and sepsis. By systematically collecting and analyzing perioperative data, the study seeks to determine independent predictors that may support improved risk stratification and patient safety in endourological practice.","Urinary stone disease is a common global health problem with an increasing incidence and significant clinical and economic burden. Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) has become a widely accepted, minimally invasive, and effective treatment option for renal and proximal ureteral stones. Advances in flexible ureteroscope design, laser technologies, and endourological instrumentation have further improved the safety, efficiency, and applicability of RIRS. As a result, there has been a marked increase in the preference for RIRS among urologists in recent years.

Despite its advantages, RIRS is associated with complication rates reported between 9% and 25%. Postoperative fever and urinary tract infection are the most frequently observed complications and may progress to sepsis, which represents a potentially life-threatening condition in patients with urinary stone disease. These infectious events remain a concern even when appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis and aseptic surgical principles are applied. Identifying risk factors that may predict postoperative infection and sepsis is therefore essential for improving perioperative decision-making and patient safety.

Previous studies have suggested potential associations between operative characteristics, preoperative bacteriuria, patient-related comorbidities, and postoperative infectious outcomes; however, most available evidence originates from retrospective analyses with limited variables. There remains a need for prospective, systematically collected data evaluating a broad set of perioperative clinical and laboratory parameters to better define predictive factors.

This prospective patient registry study aims to evaluate comprehensive perioperative variables to identify predictors of postoperative urinary tract infection and sepsis following RIRS. Parameters to be assessed include operative time, stone burden, intraoperative irrigation characteristics, perioperative cultures, and a detailed panel of inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, albumin, fibrinogen, and D-dimer. The study will also record the onset, duration, and severity of postoperative fever, together with other clinical findings relevant to infectious complications.

There is a critical need to develop an effective and durable treatment for OCRDs with demonstrable evidence for improving impaired RI. The purpose of our project is to examine the impact of a novel computerized intervention, response inhibition training (RIT), on neural indices of RI, and examine the mechanistic link between engagement of the neural RI targets and change in OCRD symptoms. To this end, this project will conduct a randomized clinical trial for individuals with OCD, trichotillomania, and/or skin picking disorders. Participants will be randomly assigned to 8 to 16 sessions of computerized RIT or a computerized placebo training. Various clinical, behavioral, and brain-imaging data will be acquired to evaluate the training effects at baseline, post-training, and 1-month follow-up periods.","Research has documented abnormal inhibition-related brain activity as well as impaired behavioral performance of RI in OCRD. Despite the growing evidence suggesting a RI deficit as a fundamental process in OCRD, no validated treatment exists that can directly alter RI deficits and in turn ameliorate OCRD symptoms. It is vital to develop a highly specific intervention that precisely engages a theoretically and empirically well-grounded target such as RI deficits, to significantly improve the efficacy of our intervention efforts. The overarching goal of this study is to examine whether the computerized cognitive training program can improve the neural indicators of the ability to inhibit inappropriate responses, and produce a clinically meaningful level of reduction in obsessive-compulsive disorder and related symptoms. Our central hypothesis is that cognitive training designed to enhance RI will improve neural indices: fronto-basal ganglia circuitry, especially right inferior frontal cortex of RI among individuals with OCRDs. We also hypothesize that the change in the RI neural circuit will mediate the consequent clinical improvements in OCRD symptomatology.

Phase I (R61) will aim to examine change in neural RI indices via the RIT intervention, Adults diagnosed with OCRD problems (OCD, TTM, or SPD) will be randomly assigned to the RIT or placebo control (PLT) condition. At pre- and post-training, neurobehavioral measures of RI will be taken, including the Stop-Signal Task (SST) assessing SSRT and fMRI task assessing rIFC activation. Each RIT participant will continue with the training within the range of 8 to 16 sessions until the criterion-level change in SSRT is attained (based on the ongoing SSRT estimation), with the PLT group receiving comparable levels of training. We will also collect 1-month follow-up data on functional outcomes in order to obtain information on the effect of the intervention on the OCRD symptom indices.

Phase II (R33) is identical to Phase I in the overall study procedures. Adults diagnosed with OCRD problems will be assigned to RIT or PLT. Analytic focus will be on the reduction in OCRD symptoms and their potential mediational pathway (rather than the change in the neural RI indices, which is the primary analytic focus in Phase I). Other than these differences, the overall flow and procedures of the study will be identical between Phases I and II.

The key assessments will include the fMRI tasks of the RI processes and clinician-administered measures of OCRD symptoms.

In addition to surviving the direct effects of the disease, the treatment of leukemia generally requires chemotherapy which has its own burden. Infection is one of the most common secondary problems faced by these patients. Simple infections are common and easily treated with aggressive antibiotics. However, treated progressive infection leads to loss of vital organ function and is termed severe sepsis. Severe sepsis is associated with increased risk of death and the need for specialized care in the intensive care unit.

Besides the appropriate use of antibiotics, little is known about what clinical and patient factors are associated with the development of severe sepsis. Recent evidence has suggested that certain practices like frequent transfusion of blood products and control of glucose levels effects outcome in critically ill patients. In addition, there have been advances in our knowledge of certain genes that may predispose people to severe infections. It is possible that these factors are important in people who are not yet critically ill, but are at risk for the development of severe sepsis.

This observational study will look at genetic, clinical and therapeutic factors that are associated with the development of severe sepsis. This will help doctors understand what treatments may be helpful in preventing this serious complication.","Primary hypothesis: Hyperglycemia during inpatient therapy of AML is associated with increased mortality (fewer hospital free days to Day 60, see below).

* H1a: Hyperglycemia will result in an increased risk of developing clinical signs of infection (fever).
* H1b: Hyperglycemia will be associated with an increased risk of developing severe sepsis after the onset of clinical signs of infection (fever).

  o H1b1: Hyperglycemia will be associated with the development of acute lung injury after the onset of signs of infection (fever).
* H1c: Hyperglycemia will be associated with an increased risk of ICU admission.

  o H1c1: Hyperglycemia will be associated with an increased risk of ICU admission for severe sepsis.
* H1d: Hyperglycemia will be associated with an increased risk of death in those subjects with severe sepsis (fewer hospital free days to Day 60, see below).

Secondary Aim: To investigate whether TSP-1 is important in modulating the course of sepsis-induced acute lung injury.

Secondary hypothesis: In patients with sepsis, increased levels of functional TSP-1 will be associated with a lower incidence of and a less severe course of lung injury.

* H2a: In human sepsis, increased TSP-1 levels will be associated with a lower incidence of lung-injury.
* H2b: In human sepsis, increased TSP-1 levels will be associated with a less severe course of lung-injury.

Algorithm for Cerebral Isch and to Test Sens./Spec. of This Algorithm in Determining Isch Stroke",,NA_00069985,That the Jan Medical Nautilus NeuroWaveTM system provides significantly higher sensitivity to hyper acute ischemic stroke than does CT.,"In spite of the fact that approximately 800,000 strokes are diagnosed in the United States each year, many physicians and patients have approached the management of stroke with a sense of futility. However, within the past 2 decades, following the advent of computerized tomography (CT), medical interest has turned toward stroke and effective interventions to treat and prevent it have received attention.

CT and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the typical diagnostic tools used in the event of a stroke alert. These studies are done on an emergent or urgent basis, since, to be effective, treatments for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke must be delivered soon after onset of the illness. In an effort to institute an appropriate therapeutic regime, laboratory and structural diagnostic studies are required to be done as rapidly as possible to determine pathological etiology, size, and location of concern.

The speed at which a diagnosis is made and a treatment plan established often determines patient outcome and any associated complications. This is especially true when evaluating patients for ischemic stroke where there is a narrow 3 hour window of opportunity in which to resolve the clot with IV .before permanent neurological impairment results, and up to 8 additional hours with the use if intra arterial (IA) t-PA or interventional mechanical embolectomy procedures are utilized. Current treatment modalities include pharmacologic thrombolytic drugs utilized to disrupt or dissolve clots located in the distal vasculature or mechanical intervention in larger vessels. Since many patients do not recognize the symptoms of stroke they do not seek medical attention immediately. Significant time is then often lost from the onset of the stroke before seeking medical help / treatment.

Although the current technologies are quite adequate as diagnostic tools for hemorrhagic stroke and for identifying subdural hematomas, and other pooled blood abnormalities which would preclude t-PA therapy, they are largely ineffective at positively identifying stroke during the limited therapeutic window of time. Positive identification of ischemia itself is rarely possible or practical with CT or within the limited therapeutic window. As such the diagnostic determination and associated treatment decisions are based on the unsatisfactory basis of exclusion.","Jan Medical, Inc.",INDUSTRY,SPONSOR,OBSERVATIONAL,False,ACTUAL,29.0,,,,,CASE_CONTROL,PROSPECTIVE,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

It is not a study to see if lenalidomide is an effective treatment for plasma cell disease.

Participants in this study have multiple myeloma or other plasma cell disease and have never been vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine. One of the effects of the drug lenalidomide is to alter the immune system and thereby increase immune response. It also has some effect against cancer cells; therefore, in theory, it may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells.

In this study, one-half of the subjects will be chosen at random to receive the study drug and the other half will take a placebo pill (a sugar pill that looks the same as the real medication). This is a double blind study where neither the subjects nor the investigators know whether the patient receives the study drugs or placebo pills. The effects of the active drug lenalidomide will be compared to the effects of the placebo. The results from this study will be also be compared with a similar but separate study to be done on individuals without known disease.

It is most often detected by an abnormal digital rectal exam or an elevated Prostate-Specific Antigen -determine by a blood test. When it is suspected that someone may have prostate cancer, a biopsy is ordered. This biopsy is performed by the Radiologist with ultrasound guidance through the rectum. In some patients, a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan of the prostate may be ordered to further evaluate the prostate. In some situations, the MRI and Ultrasound images will be fused (digitally merged) together during the ultrasound procedure to help localize the questionable lesions. Recent research has used an additional component known as a contrast agent - an intravenously injected inert substance - which is identifiable by ultrasound. This inert substance is more obvious in areas of increased blood flow, which is a common finding in cancerous lesions. In this research project, we would like to determine whether the use of contrast-enhanced ultrasound is beneficial in improving accuracy of the biopsies taken and the relative correlation to the MRI/ Ultrasound-fused images.","It is the hypothesis that cancerous lesions in the prostate will have an increased amount of blood flow, and that the lesions identified under ultrasound with the benefits of contrast-enhanced imaging can be correlated to the MRI Findings in real-time. A study of 50 patients who would be undergoing MRI/Ultrasound fusion would be selected to have contrast added to their procedure. The lesions identified on MRI would then be evaluated with contrast-enhanced ultrasound. The findings from the contrast study could then be correlated with the MRI findings. The rest of the prostate gland would also be assessed using the contrast agent for lesions not identified on the MRI imaging study. The pathology results could be correlated with both the contrast study and the MRI study both independently, and in conjunction with the two imaging modalities. If a correlation between highly suspicious lesions on the MRI and significant flow patterns under contrast can be established, then the sensitivity and specificity of contrast-enhanced ultrasound can be increased.

While MRI / Ultrasound Fusion is being shown to increase prostate cancer identification and targeting for biopsy, it is a very limited modality due to the costs associated. Many sites will also not have access to an MRI unit, and the fusion system is prohibitively expensive, and requires specialized training to configure the system and modulate the images in real-time. However, ultrasound is an in expensive modality that is readily available. If the materials and methods in the utilization of contrast-enhanced ultrasounds can be correlated to MRI / Ultrasound fusion, better protocols can be developed for contrast-enhanced ultrasound. This more cost-effective method of identifying and targeting prostate cancer could then be exported to smaller communities who would otherwise still be carrying out the sextant biopsy model.",University of British Columbia,OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,50.0,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,,DIAGNOSTIC,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

This association has been indirectly based on anecdotal improvement in the respiratory status of infants with BPD after anti-reflux therapy, but the direct causal relationship has been difficult to prove. In addition, the historical evidence for infants with GERD has been based on acid reflux only which is diagnosed by 24 hour intra-esophageal pH monitoring, the gold standard. However, with the introduction of multi-channel intraluminal impedance (MII), GERD can now include non-acid reflux. The contribution of non-acid reflux to the development of BPD in premature infants is unknown. As our understanding of GERD has improved, previous assumptions regarding the efficacy of therapy may no longer be valid. The utilization of anti-reflux surgery (fundoplication) for the treatment of BPD in premature infants with GERD has not been rigorously studied. The efficacy of fundoplication in this patient population has yet to be determined.","The University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston",OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,2.0,RANDOMIZED,SINGLE_GROUP,,TREATMENT,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Chronic pain (CP) is highly prevalent among people with opioid use disorder (OUD) who attend OTPs, with 64% of OTP patients experiencing CP and 37% reporting severe CP. OTP patients are required to attend programs frequently for medication administration, which makes the OTP an ideal location to deliver pain treatment; however, in a large national survey of people entering OUD treatment, only one-third of patients had CP treated in their program. People with OUD attending OTPs are highly marginalized and may lack access to multimodal pain management and mental health services. Integrating evidence-based treatments for CP and its associated comorbidities (such as anxiety and depression) into OTPs could have broad impact.","Training OTP counselors to deliver evidence-based pain interventions may be the ideal way to integrate pain and OUD treatment. There is a strong tradition of OTP counselors providing individual and group counseling, but it is typically focused on substance use recovery. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), an evidence-based intervention for CP, anxiety and depression, and substance use disorders, is being studied in the IMPOWR-ME center as a group-based therapy combined with outpatient buprenorphine treatment for delivery in the primary care setting. Successful delivery of ACT in OTPs would require modifying its content and format to meet the needs of the OTP setting and patients. IMPOWR-ME's ACT is a 12-session, psychologist-led intervention. ACT has been effectively delivered by lay-person facilitators and many OTP counselors are accustomed to on-the-job training. However one modifiable barrier is that OTP counselors primarily work from an abstinence-based model, which is in conflict with ACT principles (i.e. patients identifying their own values and goals). Although OTPs have a longstanding commitment to running groups, group ACT, with its structured and sequential content, may run counter to OTP norms of open attendance and unstructured discussion. Notable OTP attendance barriers such as transportation and competing priorities may also hinder completion of 12-session protocols like that of the IMPOWR-ME trial.

To address these challenges, the investigator team: 1) Trained OTP counselors to deliver ACT and provided ongoing supervision; 2) Increased OTP counselors' familiarity and technical skill in harm reduction counseling strategies (patient-identified goal setting and monitoring) to complement ACT principles; 3) Adapted ACT's format and content to be culturally aligned with OTP patients (including language, concepts and metaphors) and responsive to the needs and preferences of OTP patients for group therapy (number of sessions, use of sequential content). Perspectives of OTP patients and staff were incorporated. The 12-month pilot study consisted of the following 3 Aims:

Aim 1: Adapted the IMPOWR-ME high-intensity ACT intervention to meet the needs of an OTP. Guided by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) framework for adapting evidence-based interventions and Bernal's ecological validity model, the investigator team developed a modified ACT protocol in collaboration with the IMPOWR-ME ACT team, content experts, and OTP stakeholders. Two stakeholder studios (1 with OTP staff, 1 with OTP patients) provided input on how to adapt ACT for optimal feasibility and acceptability for OTP patients. With the IMPOWR-ME ACT team and content experts, the investigator team systematically modified ACT structure and content to address stakeholder studio recommendations. Then, 4 OTP counselors interested in serving as ACT group leaders were recruited and trained in the adapted ACT protocol.

Aim 2: Examined feasibility and acceptability of adapted ACT in an OTP and study OTP counselor fidelity to the intervention: 15 patients were recruited and enrolled to pilot the adapted ACT intervention during one of two, 12-session groups. To assess feasibility, the study team used qualitative data from in-depth interviews with OTP ACT group leaders on time, skills, and other resources required to deliver the intervention. To assess the acceptability of the intervention, the study team conducted questionnaires and in-depth interviews with patients to examine their experiences with and attitudes toward the intervention and suggestions for modifications (N=15). The investigator team examined the acceptability of the intervention to the ACT group leaders during in-depth qualitative interviews at the end of the study (N=3). ACT group leader fidelity to key principles of ACT facilitation and harm reduction principles was rated for 6 video recorded group sessions.

Aim 3, the basis of this registration, was conducted to examine changes in patient non-prescription opioid use, overdose risk behavior, anxiety, depression, pain interference, pain catastrophizing and pain acceptance pre and post-intervention. The study team administered baseline and follow-up questionnaires upon completion of the ACT intervention to assess changes in clinical outcomes. Completion of these aims provides a manual for group-based ACT for CP and OUD in OTPs and data on the feasibility and acceptability of providing ACT in OTPs. This data is going to be used to apply for a National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) R34 grant to plan a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) studying the effectiveness of ACT for CP and OUD outcomes among OTP participants.",Montefiore Medical Center,OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,7.0,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,,TREATMENT,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

The main objective of the study is to identify a quantitative score of parathyroid vascularization as an outcome of angiography that correlates with the absence of postoperative hypoparathyroidism.

It is planned to enroll 66 patients.","Postoperative hypoparathyroidism and subsequent hypocalcemia are the most frequent complications after thyroid surgery. The incidence ranges from 19-38%, depending on the definition of hypoparathyroidism and hypocalcemia.

Although the cause of postoperative hypoparathyroidism is multifactorial, one of the most important factors is vascularization of parathyroid glands left in situ that is insufficient or impaired by surgical manipulation. Therefore, one of the goals of thyroid surgery is not only to recognize the parathyroid glands during dissection but also to respect their vascularization in order to preserve well perfused and viable glands.

The general objective of this study is to quantitatively assess the vascularization of the parathyroids following total thyroid removal.

In particular, the investigators intend to obtain data regarding parathyroid vascularization during total thyroidectomy with indocyanine green angiography.

The service is provided in school environment. First, the study will assess the effectiveness of brief interventions provided by psychiatric outreach nurses on the perceived mental health and quality of life of adolescents (12-16 year old pupils) and their use of social and health services, compared to the support/treatment provided by conventional student welfare services at 6 and 12 months follow-up. The intervention is an outreach service provided by psychiatric nurses. In the intervention, the psychiatric registered nurse will implement interventions such as usual care, discussion, psychoeducation, substance abuse skills and various methods (such as interpersonal psychotherapy = IPT-N and Cool Kids) and motivational interviewing.

Secondly, an economic evaluation of the service will be carried out at 6 and 12 months follow-up. The economic evaluation will be carried out from the perspective of the Wellbeing Services County, including the costs of implementing the intervention model and its effects on adolescents' use of student welfare services as well as other social and health services. Primarily, the economic evaluation will use quality-weighted life years as a measure of effectiveness. Also analysis using depression, anxiety and substance use measures will be conducted. Thirdly, the study will explore the experiences of psychiatric nurses implementing the service as well as the experiences of their collaborators in schools (public health nurses, school social workers, psychologists, doctors and teachers) about the service and its implementation.","Quantitative research data will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the psychiatric outreach care compared to conventional care (TAU). Psychiatric outreach registered nurses are currently available in some schools in several municipalities in the North Savo region in Finland. In the other schools, support is provided by so-called ""usual"" counselling and other support/treatment, e.g. by public health nurses, school social workers, school psychologists and school doctors.

The study design is a clustered controlled setting. The target sample size for quantitative data is 160 participants. The intervention group (n = 80) will consist of pupils receiving support/treatment from psychiatric outreach nurses. The control group (n = 80) will consist of pupils whose schools provide standard student welfare services and whose mental health status and support needs are similar to those of the intervention group.

The data will be collected through questionnaires administered to secondary school pupils to assess their mental health status and quality of life. The adolescents' service use in terms of student welfare services as well as Wellbeing Services County's social and health care services will be collected through questionnaires. At baseline, the use of services will be surveyed retrospectively over a six-month period.

The primary outcome variable of the intervention is the adolescent's perceived mental health status as assessed by the PHQ-9-A (Patient Health Questionnaire) measure of depression and the GAD-7 (generalized anxiety disorder) measure of anxiety. The secondary outcome variables are the adolescent's perceived quality of life (EQ-5D-Y, five dimensional quality of life measure) and substance use (ADSUME, Adolescents´ Substance Use Measurement). The study will primarily investigate the effect of psychiatric outreach nurses on treatment response. Secondarily, subgroups of at least 20 participants will be examined (e.g. controls for gender, age or other background variables).

Participants are assigned to the intervention or control group based on whether the services of an psychiatric outreach nurse is available in their school (intervention) or not (control).

For similarities and differences between the intervention and control groups, a descriptive analysis is performed using the chi-square test to compare categorical variables and the t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test to compare continuous variables. The effectiveness of the intervention will be analysed using statistical methods appropriate for panel data, taking into account the effects of possible correlation/multicollinearity on the results. Statistical methods will be used to control for the possible selection of a non-standardised design by including control variables in the models.

The economic evaluation of the intervention will use data on the use of social and health services, student welfare services and the cost of the intervention. Data on the costs of the intervention will be obtained from the Wellbeing Services County of North Savo. The costs of health and social services and student welfare services are calculated on the basis of the number of services used and the unit costs. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention is analysed in relation to the treatment as usual provided by student welfare services using incremental net monetary benefit or incremental net health benefit evaluation to examine differences in costs and/or health benefits between groups and in the above-mentioned outcomes at 6-month and 12-month follow-up. Primarily, the economic evaluation will use the EQ-5D-Y measure to calculate quality-weighted life-years. In addition, the results of the PHQ-9-A, GAD-7 and ADSUME measures will be analysed.

Eligibility Criteria: Pupils (12-16 years old) who seek help from a student welfare service due to mood disorders. In addition, a representative of the student welfare service (e.g. a public health nurse, school social worker, psychologist or doctor) or a representative of the student welfare service and an psychiatric outreach nurse assess together a person's eligibility for the study, taking into account the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Inclusion criteria for the intervention and control groups will be one or more of the following symptoms: prolonged and/or complicated anxiety, mood symptoms, obsessive-compulsive and/or eating disorder symptoms, mild to moderate self-harm (e.g. death wishes or cutting). In addition, the young person's motivation to receive the service is an admission criterion.

Exclusion criteria: The psychiatric outreach nurse service is not suitable for persons with one or more of the following needs or life situations: pupils who need light support and guidance, young people with a single problem of low motivation for school, young people with a stressful life situation or relationship problems. On the other hand, the service is not intended for pupils who are in acute need of specialist care or for pupils with multidisciplinary problems for whom support measures have already been put in place, because of their mental health symptoms (e.g. severe depression, psychotic symptoms, severe and acute suicidal tendencies or a clear suicide plan). Exclusion criteria for the intervention and control groups also include situations where the young person has a long-lasting, already established mental health problem and/or a need for further treatment after a period of specialised hospital care. Exclusion criteria also include behavioural disorders where there is a clear underlying cause other than a mental disorder.

The qualitative perspective of the study focuses on those implementing the service (psychiatric outreach nurses) and their collaborators in schools (e.g. school social workers, public health nurses, school psychologists, doctors and teachers). The total number of interviewees is estimated to be 15-20. Data collection consists of individual semi-structured interviews to describe the interviewees' experiences of applying the new service approach in the school setting. As the approach is new in the Wellbeing Services County of North Savo, it is necessary to explore the experiences of both those implementing as well as their collaborators in terms of introducing the service, operation of the service, the perceived needs for the service as well as the needs for development of the service.

The randomized study design allows direct comparability of the outcome after either core decompression and nonvascularized osseous autografting from the iliac crest or core decompression and osseous autografting with a free microvascular medial femoral condyle.

Talar avascular necrosis is caused by osseous malperfusion leading to malnutrition and destruction of the talar bone. The extend of this malperfusion is variable and can be categorized in 4 stages. The osseous defects can remain without consequences (stage I) or lead to irreversible talar destruction. The current treatment option for stage II and III is the core decompression followed by osseous auto grafting from the iliac crest. Reducing the intraosseal pressure and filling the drill holes with the nonvascularized bone graft can lead to reperfusion of the talus.

A new technique is to fill the drill hole with a vascularized bone graft from the medial femoral condyle, using microvascular anastomosis. This procedure has already been approved for the treatment of avascular necrosis and malperfusion of the carpus (lunate and scaphoid) as well as the femoral head.

Management focuses on controlling symptoms, correcting precipitants, avoiding triggers, and improving quality-of-life. The combination of recent preclinical and clinical data suggests that localized cardiac RT is relatively safe and has positive conductive and anti-proliferative effects in the ""sick"" heart. In this Phase 1 study, the investigators aim to assess the feasibility and safety of 5 Gy whole heart radiotherapy in six (6) ESHF participants with limited options for further medical therapy to control their disease. The investigators hypothesize that 5 Gy whole heart radiotherapy can improve LVEF and decrease blood markers of heart failure and inflammation including B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), C-reactive protein (CRP), and troponins, while also having a very tolerable side effect profile.","HEART FAILURE Heart Failure (HF) is a heterogeneous syndrome manifested by vascular congestion and/or peripheral hypoperfusion in the setting of structural and/or functional cardiac abnormalities. Congestion commonly presents with dyspnea, reduced exercise tolerance, and edema while hypoperfusion results in end-organ dysfunction. HF is a major public health problem and because of its age-dependent increase in incidence and prevalence, it's one of the leading causes of death and hospitalization among the elderly. As a consequence of the worldwide increase in life expectancy, and due to improvements in the treatment of HF in recent years, the proportion of participants that reach an advanced phase of the disease, so-called ESHF, is steadily growing.

HF is characterized by impairment in cardiac structure and function which, in its advanced phases, results in decreased cardiac output (hypoperfusion) and/or fluid buildup (congestion). Initially cardiac output (CO) is maintained through the Frank-Starling mechanism with LV dilation and wall thickening. Eventually myocardial contractility declines and stroke volume (SV) decreases . A compensatory increase in heart rate (HR) may initially help maintain cardiac output, but this too will ultimately fail to preserve output. Currently, patients with HF are most often categorized as having heart failure with reduced (HFrEF; LVEF \<40%), mid-range (HFmrEF; LVEF 40-49%) or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF; LVEF ≥50%). The four classical hemodynamic profiles of heart failure can be categorized in a two-by-two matrix based on filling pressures (presence or absence of congestion) and perfusion status (adequate/inadequate). Furthermore, patients are classified by the New York Heart Association (NYHA) based on the presence or absence of symptoms during rest and physical activity (Figure 2). Patients with ESHF typically live in the NYHA Class III-IV and in a fine balance between the ""wet and warm"" (i.e. relatively preserved perfusion but congested) and ""wet and cold"" (i.e. low perfusion and congested) categories.

The two principal pathways mediating the pathophysiology of heart failure are the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). These systems are innately related, having the ability to further activate each other and ultimately resulting in a chronic state of increased effective circulating volume. Over time, myocardial alterations result in reduced responsiveness to these adaptive mechanisms, and thus a drop in cardiac output ensues. Not surprisingly the principal HF therapies target these pathways. The primary therapies have been comprised of the triad of ACE inhibitors (or angiotensin receptor blockers \[ARB\] if intolerant), beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists (beta-blockers), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) titrated to target doses. Unfortunately, in ESHF, medical optimization is often not tolerated because of worsening hypotension, hyperkalemia, and renal dysfunction. There is often a need to reduce the dose or eliminate these therapies which is a well-established marker of poor prognosis. Once diagnosed with ESHF focus turns towards defining the optimal therapeutic approach with options including orthotopic heart transplant (OHT), left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and/or palliation. Ultimately, a combination of these three strategies is often required.

Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is generally viewed as a clinically useful phenotypic marker indicative of underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and sensitivity to therapy.

End-stage heart failure (ESHF) manifests as severe and often relentless symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, abdominal discomfort and ultimately cardiac cachexia with renal and hepatic dysfunction frequently further complicating the process. Recurrent hospitalizations, cardiac arrhythmias, and intolerance to standard HF therapies are common as the disease progresses. Management focuses on controlling symptoms, correcting precipitants, avoiding triggers, and improving quality-of-life (QOL).

RADIATION THERAPY Radiation therapy involves delivering high energy x-rays precisely to a target with minimal dose to the surrounding clinical tissues. Accuracy in radiation therapy requires effective patient immobilization, precise target localization, and highly conformed dosimetry and isotropic dose fall-off. Dose calculations involve algorithms that account for effects of tissue heterogeneities, and the linear accelerators that deliver the treatment are also equipped with multileaf collimators and have the ability of using multiple non-overlapping beams of radiation as well as intensity modulated radiation therapy to maximize accuracy of target dose deposition while minimizing surrounding organ dose.

Radiation therapy is used in many malignant and benign conditions with a variety of dose and fractionation schemes. For malignant diseases in the palliative setting, radiation therapy is delivered to painful or progressive sites of disease in a highly focused manner with significant benefit on controlling pain, local progression, and quality of life. Typical doses for these types of treatment vary and can be limited to 8 Gy in a single fraction. These treatments are tolerated extremely well by almost all patients with almost no side effects.

Radiation therapy (RT) is utilized half of all patients with a cancer diagnosis. RT is effective in reducing populations of highly proliferative cells, a common feature of malignant disease. RT is also used successfully to treat many non-malignant disorders, including hyperproliferative and inflammatory conditions. The RT doses required for these non-malignant disorders are often much smaller and carry a lighter burden of adverse effects. Recently, a number of human and murine studies indicate that in heart failure (HF), proliferating macrophages and fibroblasts are major mediators of collateral tissue injury and progressive disease. Strategies that ablate these highly proliferative precursors in preclinical models attenuate features of heart failure progression.

The use of high-dose stereotactic radiation therapy in patients with cardiac arrhythmias, specifically ventricular tachycardia (VT), has been shown to reduce arrhythmia burden in several human clinical trials and case series. In these studies, a single dose (25 Gy) of non-invasive electrophysiologically guided localized RT was safe, substantially reduced VT, improved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and improved quality of life (QOL) in 50-70% of patients with no other options for therapy. The initial hypothesis for this effect was that RT would create a scar, similar to how invasive catheter therapies are utilized to ablate arrhythmias. However, subsequent mechanistic studies suggest that rather than simply scarring the targeted tissue, RT stimulates physiologic changes including increased sodium channel (NaV1.5) and connexin-43 (Cx-43) expression, increasing conduction velocity within the heart. These physiologic changes were also seen outside of the 25Gy target areas, suggesting that smaller doses of radiation is sufficient to stimulate these effects. Retrospective analysis of the RT dosimetry from patients treated for VT demonstrated that 5 Gy was reflective of the approximate whole heart dose received outside of the targeted scar in these patients. A recent hypothesis postulated that 5 Gy may be sufficient to upregulate pro-conductive proteins and signaling pathways while attenuating cardiac remodeling via decreasing levels of macrophages and fibroblasts; the primary proliferative precursors to adverse cardiac remodeling in many models of cardiac injury. This was investigated in murine heart failure models, which demonstrated that 5 Gy of cardiac radiation delivered after injury attenuated adverse cardiac remodeling, improved LVEF, reduced fibrosis, and decreased proliferation of macrophages and fibroblasts.

HYPOTHESIS The combination of recent preclinical and clinical data suggests that localized cardiac RT is relatively safe and has positive conductive and anti-proliferative effects in the ""sick"" heart. In this Phase 1 study, the investigators aim to assess the feasibility and safety of 5 Gy whole heart radiotherapy in six (6) ESHF participants with limited options for further medical therapy to control their disease in a 3+3 study design. The investigators hypothesize that 5 Gy whole heart radiotherapy is a safe therapy with a limited side effect profile that may improve LVEF and decrease blood markers of heart failure and inflammation including B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), C-reactive protein (CRP), troponins, lactate, and neturophil to lymphocyte ratio.

INTERIM REVIEW OF DATA, ESCALATION, AND DE-ESCALATION CRITERIA A data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) composed of two radiation oncologists and one cardiologists outside of the study team will review the data 30 days after the first 3 participants are treated. They will have the authority to stop the study based on the following dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) rule: all 3 patients with grade 3+ toxicity, or any grade 4+ toxicity classified as probably, or definitely related to the study intervention. Toxicities are based on CTCAE v5.0 definitions. Following this review, for the purpose of escalation and de-escalation, escalation-limiting toxicity (ELT) will be defined as any grade 3+ toxicity considered possibly, probably, or definitely related to the treatment intervention.

The following de-escalation, and escalation rules will be applied. There will be, at most, 4 dose levels. Escalation and de-escalation rules follow.

* Dose 1 (5 Gy) - starting dose based on rationale described in protocol
* Dose 0 (3 Gy) - de-escalation dose following 2 ELTs
* Dose 2 (7 Gy) - escalation dose 1 following no ELTs at Dose 1
* Dose 3 (9 Gy) - escalation dose 2 if no ELTs encountered at Dose 2

Following the treatment of 3 patients at dose level 1 (5 Gy), If one patient experiences a ELT, then 3 additional patients are enrolled at dose level 1 (5 Gy), for a maximum of 6 patients. If none of these patients experience a ELT then 3 patients would be enrolled at dose level 2 (7 Gy). If only one of those 6 patients experience a ELT, then the next 3 patients will be enrolled at dose level 2 (7 Gy).

The study continues in this fashion until no more than 1 of 6 patients treated at the highest dose level experience a ELT. At any dose level, if 2 patients experience a ELT, then dose de-escalation is to occur, with 6 total patients enrolled at that dose level.

PARTICIPANT TREATMENT SIMULATION Prior to radiation treatment planning, participants will be immobilized and a free-breathing CT simulation with 3 mm slice thickness will be performed. Respiratory correlated four-dimensional tomographic (4D-CT) images will be acquired to assess the extent of cardiac and respiratory motion. The average CT derived from 4D-CT images will be used for target and organ at risk (OAR) delineation as well as radiotherapy treatment planning.

RADIATION THERAPY TARGET VOLUMES The treatment target will be delineated using conventional radiotherapy definitions. The clinical target volume (CTV) will be defined on the simulation CT as the entire contour of the muscular heart excluding the pericardium. An ITV will be generated based on the motion seen on the 4D-CT, to encompass the combined respiratory and cardiac motion during free-breathing. A planning target volume (PTV) of up to 5 mm will be generated as a volumetric expansion from the ITV to account for uncertainties in planning and treatment delivery. Prior to creating a radiation treatment plan, organs-at-risk (OARs) including the spinal cord, stomach, liver, spleen, trachea, bronchi, lungs, and esophagus will be delineated.

TREATMENT PLAN, EVALUATION, AND QUALITY ASSURANCE Participants will be prescribed between 3Gy and 9 Gy in 1 fraction depending on which stage of escalation/de-escalation the trial is at. The plan will be normalized aiming for 95% coverage of the PTV volume by the 100% isodose. RT will be delivered with a 6 MV energy beam, using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) through partial arcs. Beam geometry will be optimized to avoid any defibrillator or pacemaker in place. Quality assurance (QA) for each treatment plan includes a group review of contours and plan by the radiation oncology, cardiology and medical physics study team members, as well as the standard departmental two-step plan verification prior to treatment and presentation at departmental QA rounds.",McGill University Health Centre/Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,6.0,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,"6 participants with end-stage heart failure (NYHA 3 or 4, LVEF \< 30%) with no other standard of care therapy options to receive whole heart radiation therapy.",TREATMENT,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

An estimated 50-75 percent of infants with severe (stage 3) HIE will die, with 55 percent of these deaths occurring in the first month. Up to 80 percent of infants who survive stage 3 HIE develop significant long-term disabilities, including intellectual disabilities, epilepsy, and cerebral palsy with hemiplegia, paraplegia, or quadriplegia; 10-20 percent develop moderately serious disabilities; and up to 10 percent are normal.

Currently, infants diagnosed with HIE at less than six hours of age are given whole-body cooling, decreasing their core body temperature to 33.5°C (93.2° Fahrenheit) for a period 72 hours using a cooling blanket. This treatment appears to protect the brain, decreasing the rate of death and disability and improving the chances of survival and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months correct age. But additional trials are needed to help define the most effective cooling strategies.

The Optimizing Cooling trial will examine whether cooling for a longer time period and/or to a lower temperature will improve the chance of survival and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18-22 months corrected age. Eligible infants with HIE will be placed in one of four cooling groups: (1) cooling for 72 hours to 33.5°C; (2) cooling for 120 hours to 33.5°C; (3) cooling for 72 hours to 32.0°C; and (4) cooling for 120 hours to 32.0°C. Infants will be monitored closely and receive the care of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU).

Infants enrolled in the study will be placed on a cooling blanket - the same type of blanket children's hospitals use in the NICU, in operating rooms during surgeries, and to cool children with high fevers. Each infant will be cooled according to the study group he or she is assigned to. During cooling, the infant's temperature will be very closely monitored by continuous esophageal (core)temperature readings. This will be done by placing a soft, narrow, flexible plastic tube into the infant's nose and down to just above the stomach. Skin temperatures will also be monitored closely. At the end of the assigned period of cooling, the infant will be slowly re-warmed until a normal core temperature of 36.5 to 37.0°C (97.7 to 98.6°C) is reached.

Infants will be examined at 18-22 months corrected age to assess their neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Secondary Studies include:

A. Using aEEG to 1)predict mortality or moderate to severe disability at 18-22 months in term infants with HIE treated with systemic hypothermia and 2) to record electrical seizure activity to compare rewarming initiated at 72 hours and later rewarming that is initiated at 120 hours.

A sample size of 40 patients who meet all eligibility criteria will be enrolled to receive study treatment. Patients will receive treatment until either disease progression or toxicity has occurred with a maximum planned of six 28-day cycles.

Daratumumab will be administrated every week for the first 2 cycles then. every 2 weeks from cycle 3 through cycle 6.

Patients will also receive best supportive care (BSC) to mitigate Daratumumab side-effects, and to address underlying Amyloidosis, including blood product transfusions, antimicrobials, and (as appropriate) growth factors including granulocyte colony-stimulating factors for neutropenia, erythropoietin for anaemia, and/or transfusions for thrombocytopenia","Systemic AL amyloidosis is a rare disease caused by the deposition of misfolded monoclonal immunoglobulin free light chains (FLC) in various tissues and organs. It is usually associated with a clonal plasma cell dyscrasia with a low tumour burden. Treatment of AL amyloidosis relies mainly on chemotherapy aimed at suppressing the underlying plasma cell clone secreting monoclonal FLC. The organ responses and the survival are greatly influenced by the degree of hematological response evaluated by the decrease in serum FLC that has been the principal endpoint in recent trials in AL amyloidosis. The goal of treatment is to reach at least a very good partial response (VGPR) defined as a difference between the involved FLC and the normal \<40 mg/l.

Over the last 2 years, Daratumumab, a novel, high-affinity, therapeutic, human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) that specifically recognizes the CD38 epitope has emerged as a breakthrough targeted therapy for patients with myeloma. Taking into account that, in 90% of AL patients, the monoclonal cells producing amyloidogenic FLC are Cluster of Differentiation 38 (CD38) expressing plasma cells Daratumumab should be a promising treatment in AL amyloidosis.

The study will consist of 4 steps:

* A 21 day screening period This period start with screening visit which may occurs up to 21 days before the first study drug administration. After signature of the informed consent form, procedures will be performed to ensure patient meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria and document health status to receive study treatment. These assessments will include quality of life questionnaires
* A treatment period Patient eligible to enter the study will receive 6 cycles of 28 days of intra venous Daratumumab. During cycles 1 and 2, Daratumumab will be administered weekly at days 1, 8, 15, and 22 then from cycles 3 to 6, Daratumumab will be administered every two weeks at days 1 and 15. Patient will have assessments at the ignition of a new cycle to document haematological and organs response and intra cycle to watch for toxicities.
* An end of study visit (when PD or unacceptable adverse events occurs, or planned end of study visit). Study procedures will be performed at 28 days (± 15) after the last dose of study medication for all patients, including early termination patients.
* Followup period After treatment discontinuation, followup will be made to the patient every 3 months for at least 1 year to inquire about the patient's hematological and organ status, general health, and information on any new medical events.

Not only do patients suffering from jaundice show significant symptoms of exhaustion and purities, but they are also at higher risk for developing post-operative complications. Experimentally, the liver exhibits a reduced capacity for tolerating ischemia in the presence of jaundice. Several different etiologic factors suggest cause complication such as presence of toxic substances as bilirubin and bile salts, impaired nutritional status, effects of endotoxins, bacterial translocation, modulation of the inflammatory cascade with cytokine release, reduction of cellular immunity and nutritional. These complications primarily consist of septic complications (cholangitis, abscesses, and leakage), haemorrhage, impaired wound healing and renal disorders. Summarily, these issues have motivated pre-operative bile flow drainage by way of stent. Traditionally, pre-operative bile flow drainage has been achieved by insertion of a EP because these are considered easy to remove and cause less tissue reaction in the bile ducts. However, multiple studies have found the disadvantage with the EP is that it provides poorer bile drainage than the SEMS.

In palliative situations, metal stents have been associated with fewer side-effects in the form of fever relapse of jaundice, etc. These effects are likely due to better bile flow through the stent.

Novel and innovative interventions targeting cocaine abuse are needed. The Transtheoretical Model of behavior change (TTM) offers a comprehensive framework for understanding, measuring, and intervening in behavior change and provides a strong theoretical foundation upon which effective treatments for substance abuse can be developed. The proposed Stage 1 research will pilot test a novel and innovative behavioral group therapy for cocaine users based on the TTM. In Phase 1, investigators will modify the newly developed Group Treatment for Substance Abuse: A Stages-of-Change Therapy Manual (Velasquez, Maurer, Crouch \& DiClemente, 2001) to specifically target cocaine abuse resulting in a twelve-session, group intervention and accompanying therapy manual based on the TTM stages and processes of change: six ""early stage"" sessions targeting the experiential processes of change, and six ""later stage"" sessions targeting the behavioral processes of change.

Modalities include; Angioplasty/stent (Control group, Guidant), Cryoplasty/stent (Boston Scientific), Laser Angioplasty/stent (Spectranetics), SilverHawk Atherectomy/stent (Fox Hollow), and Viabahn Endograft (WL Gore).","Peripheral vascular occlusive disease is a progressive and often debilitating form of atherosclerosis affecting the vessels of the upper and lower extremities. Patients typically present with complaints of pain in the involved extremity (claudication), others present with numbness, heaviness, or fatigue in the affected limb. With regards to the progression of the disease, up to 10% of patients with intermittent claudication may progress to limb loss over the course of 5 years. Past studies indicated that 2/3 of the patients' symptoms remained stable. Most recent studies, however, suggest that the natural history results in more disabling symptoms.

These patients can be evaluated with non-invasive studies including Ankle-Brachial Indices (ABI) or arterial duplex to assess the arterial flow. If stenosis or total occlusion is identified, an invasive study (angiogram) may be necessary. From these studies we are able to determine if the patient is a candidate for either a traditional surgical procedure (bypass) or a percutaneous treatment, similar to the angiogram.

The superficial femoral artery (SFA) has been the region most difficult to treat and maintain patency. Stenosis and/or occlusion often can occur by 6 months. Results of balloon angioplasty and stenting in the femoropopliteal segment have been for the most part variable and often with poor results. The SFA and popliteal arteries are extremely difficult to treat because the diffuse nature of disease, high degree of recoil, amplified reactivity, large number of occlusions, calcification, and the impact of inflow and run-off.

Angioplasty alone, is limited by a high frequency of dissection, significant recoil, and unacceptably high restenosis rates. While stenting has made an acute impact on dissection and recoil, restenosis rates have only modestly improved over time. More aggressive stent utilization has created other problems; in-stent restenosis, occlusion and stent-strut fracture.

Now, percutaneous revascularization has become an option for many patients due to a minimal invasive nature. Various other modalities have been used most recently to treat the femoropopliteal region, including the cool laser, atherectomy, cryoplasty and endoluminal grafts in an attempt to obtain a long-lasting result. At present, few studies compare the use of other devices different from stents in this anatomical location.

Randomization is done before the intervention by opening a sealed envelope containing the type of procedure. All procedures will be done under systemic heparinization using 3 to 5K ui of IV heparin. All cases will be approached percutaneously from the contralateral CFA to prevent that the access site interfere with patency outcome (i.e., antegrade approach). The use of stents as adjunctive Rx in laser, atherectomy, balloon angioplasty and cryoplasty cases will be a sole decision of the interventionist. PTA and stent will be the control group. To maintain uniformity, the stent to be used during the entire series will be the Guidant ""Absolute"" stent. The laser probe to be used in the study, is the 2.0, 2.2, or 2.5 mm (0.35 compatible) concentric catheter - Spectranetics. The endoluminal graft for the series is the Viabahn - W.L. Gore.

10b379a8cee04775,NCT01955317,Waterless Hand Cleansing With Chlorhexidine During the Perinatal Period,Waterless Hand Cleansing With Chlorhexidine During the Perinatal Period,,PR-13023,"Background (brief):

1. Burden:

   Neonatal death still unacceptably high in low income countries. The common causes of neonatal death are pneumonia, sepsis and omphalitis. Many neonatal infections occur because the mother's hands or the hands of the person who attended the birth are unclean. Our previous study found that there was substantial concern about excessive exposure of the mother or the neonate to water during handwashing because of the perception that frequent contact with water could lead to respiratory illness.
2. Knowledge gap:

   Chlorhexidine has been evaluated for use in hand hygiene applications in high-income countries, particularly in healthcare, but it has not been evaluated or promoted for hand cleansing at the household level in low- and middle-income countries.
3. Relevance:

A waterless hand cleanser employing chlorhexidine would overcome important barriers to handwashing with soap, perceptions of cold resulting from exposure to water, and the time limitations perceived by mothers.

Hypothesis: Mothers who are exposed to a chlorhexidine-based hand cleansing intervention will clean their hands (with chlorhexidine or soap and water) more frequently than mothers who are not exposed to the chlorhexidine-based hand cleansing program.

Objectives:

The primary objective

1. To demonstrate the behavioural impact of chlorhexidine-based hand hygiene intervention on hand cleansing of mothers during the neonatal period The secondary objectives
2. To demonstrate the impact of chlorhexidine-based hand hygiene intervention on hand cleansing of other family members, visitors to the neonate, and birth attendants during the neonatal period
3. To evaluate the acceptability of chlorhexidine for hand cleansing in the neonatal period among mothers, other family members, and birth attendants

Methods:

We propose a randomized controlled trial in a rural area of Bangladesh, with an active control. Randomization will be at the level of the participating pregnant woman. Each arm will include 150 participants. All intervention visits will follow baseline data collection. A trained health and hygiene promoter will carry out two visits in the antenatal period and one postnatal visit to deliver intervention messages.

Outcome measures:

1. Observed hand cleansing behavior of mother with chlorhexidine or soap and water at critical times.
2. Observed hand cleansing behavior of other household members and visitors to home with chlorhexidine or soap and water at critical times.","Neonates (babies \< 28 days old) die at unacceptably high rates (26deaths per 1000 live births) in many resource-limited countries, accounting for about 40% of deaths among all children under 5 years old. Infections such as pneumonia, sepsis, and omphalitis are common causes of neonatal death. Many neonatal infections occur because the mother's hands or the hands of the person who attended the birth are unclean. In Nepal, newborns who survived were significantly more likely than newborns who died to have mothers reporting handwashing, and birth attendants who were reported to wash hands before the delivery. But, mothers and birth attendants often do not wash their hands, despite the vulnerability of the neonatal period.

The traditional approach to improving handwashing among caregivers of young children is to teach about critical times to wash hands and how to wash hands. This narrow, prescriptive approach ignores the barriers to hand hygiene unique to the Perinatal and neonatal periods. Moreover, our qualitative findings suggest that frequent handwashing with water may not be acceptable. That is, both mothers and birth attendants reported that, when mothers come into contact with water frequently (e.g. by washing hands often), the newborn child is at risk of developing upper and lower respiratory infection. A novel technological solution - one that provides efficiency and portability and obviates the need for washing with water - may overcome important obstacles to improving hand cleansing behavior in the neonatal period.

During the discrete time frame of the neonatal period, chlorhexidine for hand cleansing represents a focused intervention with substantial potential for scalability. The shelf-life of chlorhexidine is long (2-3 years), facilitating its scaling up and efficient distribution, for example, in clean delivery kits that are provided to low-income mothers throughout resource-limited countries.

Given the potential for this low-technology solution to break through critical barriers to handwashing with water and soap, and markedly reduce neonatal mortality, we propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a chlorhexidine-based hand cleansing intervention on maternal, familial, and birth attendant hand cleansing behavior in the peripartum and neonatal periods.

Methods Study design

We propose a randomized controlled trial in a rural area of Bangladesh, with an active control. The two treatment arms are:

* Active control arm Maternal and neonatal health counseling (described in ""Intervention"" section)
* Intervention arm

  * Maternal and neonatal health counseling
  * Hand hygiene promotion (described in ""Intervention"" section) Randomization will be at the level of the participating pregnant woman (i.e. individual-level randomization). We will use a block randomization strategy to randomize participants to either the intervention or active control arm.

The intervention:

All intervention visits will follow baseline data collection. A trained health and hygiene promoter will carry out two visits in the antenatal period (at 34-35 weeks and at 36-38 weeks) and one postnatal visit (1-3 days after delivery) to deliver intervention messages.

Maternal and neonatal health counseling:

Study participants in both intervention and control arms will receive maternal and neonatal health counseling. The objectives of the maternal and neonatal health counseling are to:

* Highlight the vulnerability of the neonatal period
* Inform participant and her family of the schedule recommended by the Government of Bangladesh for prenatal care and strongly encourage participants to seek appropriate prenatal care, including Tetanus Toxoid vaccination. Tetanus toxoid is provided free of cost as part of antenatal care at all Government of Bangladesh health facilities.
* Discuss birth plans and encourage participants to develop a birth plan, including location of the birth, materials, persons needed and an emergency plan.
* Introduce and discuss the use of a clean delivery kit for hygienic delivery to reduce infections. This will include instructions on cutting the umbilical cord. Provide a clean delivery kit to the participant, which will include a clean blade, clean string for tying the cord, clean mat for the mother to lie on, among other items.
* Encourage close family members to motivate or demand hand washing with soap by birth attendants before and during labor and delivery.
* Discuss maternal danger signs with participant and her family and encourage care seeking when recognized
* Discuss neonatal danger signs with participant and her family and encourage care seeking when recognized
* Discuss neonatal hypothermia prevention with participant and her family and work with the family to build acceptance of the message
* Discuss the benefit of immediate and exclusive breastfeeding with participant and her family and work with the family to build acceptance of the message
* Provide chlorhexidine and gauze, and explain chlorhexidine cord care to the participant and work with her and her family.

Materials: Each participant will be given a clean delivery kit and a culturally appropriate pictorial card depicting each of the danger signs for the mother pre-, during, and post-labor, and for the neonate.

Description of behavioral communication approach: Interactions with the health and hygiene promoter will be in the form of a discussion where the health/hygiene promoter will facilitate discussions and provide explanation and guidance as needed.

Hand hygiene counseling:

Objectives of hand hygiene counseling:

* Present hand cleansing as an opportunity for the mother to protect the health of her child, and to improve perception of herself as a good mother
* Remind of the vulnerability of the newborn period, and suggest that the use of chlorhexidine for hand cleansing makes loving hands to be protective hands
* Encourage maternal self-efficacy for protecting the health of the baby
* Identify motivators and barriers to hand cleansing among mothers and other people that care for the baby
* Identify critical times for hand cleansing with chlorhexidine
* Increase individual and social (family/compound) expectations for hand cleansing among mothers and other caregivers
* Guide family to create solution for barriers to hand cleansing
* Introduce chlorhexidine as a product to help protect the baby's health, demonstrate use and discuss who, when and how to use it.
* Discuss demanding or motivating use of chlorhexidine by other family members, visitors and the birth attendant
* Set up a visual cue card, and a calendar with visual reminders in the home as references and cues for hand cleansing at specific critical times
* Discuss creating a habit of hand cleansing, what that concretely means and how to do so

Critical times for hand cleansing:

* For mothers and secondary caregivers:
* Before umbilical cord care
* After contact with respiratory secretions
* At three fixed times of day: morning, after lunch, and evening: given the residual antimicrobial effect of chlorhexidine, hand cleansing at these fixed times will result in hands being protected from contamination for much of the day.
* For visitors to the household and for children:
* Before touching the neonate
* After contact with respiratory secretions or contact with nasal or oral mucosa

Timing of intervention visits:

Respondents randomized to the intervention arm will receive one hand hygiene promotion during the second visit (at 36-38 weeks of gestation) prior to the review of the maternal and neonatal health counseling.

Chlorhexidine for hand cleansing: We are positioning chlorhexidine as a product that is of unique importance in the neonatal period, and may have substantive bactericidal and bacteriostatic effects, making it superior to soap for hand cleansing, particularly in the vulnerable newborn period.

Data collection Identification of pregnant women and selection criteria: The proposed study will be conducted in 4 unions in Mirzapur that are already under demographic surveillance. Pregnant women are routinely identified as part of the demographic surveillance.

Obtaining informed consent and baseline data collection: A data collector will describe the study to the pregnant woman at 32-34 weeks gestation and seek informed consent from her for participation. The data collector will also request informed consent from the head of household for interview of secondary caregivers regarding practices during the labor and delivery process, and two structured observations of hand cleansing behavior among all household members.

Randomization and initiation of intervention: We will use a block randomization strategy, using blocks of 4, to randomize participants to either the intervention or active control arm. Block randomization is also referred to as ""restricted randomization"" and allows for the numbers in the intervention arm to be roughly similar to those in the control arm throughout the enrolment period.

Objectives 1 and 2: Hand cleansing behavior measurement

To compare treatment arms with respect to mothers' hand cleansing behavior in the neonatal period (Objective 1), we will do the following:

1. Observe hand cleansing, either by use of chlorhexidine or by handwashing with water + soap, during 3-hour structured observations
2. Measure residual sanitizer weight and volume as markers of chlorhexidine consumption Structured observations involve the placement of a study staff member in the participant's home / household compound for an extended period of time in order to observe typical behaviors. In this study the observations will be conducted in both intervention and treatment arms by female field staff who will sit in a suitable place to observe the mothers without getting in the way of their normal care giving activities of the neonates. We are interested in observing the following behaviors during structured observations (Appendix 6).

Hand cleansing at critical times (either by chlorhexidine use or by washing hands with soap and water; handwashing with soap will be considered the corollary to chlorhexidine use since the control arm does not have access to chlorhexidine) Objective 3: Acceptability of chlorhexidine In both groups, we will record participant- or household member-initiated reporting of any skin reactions, other possible adverse events, and acceptability of the chlorhexidine with respect to ease of use, scent, skin comfort and the occurrence of skin reactions (Objective 3).

At approximately day 28 of the neonate's life, we will conduct an end line survey (Appendix 7) with the mother, during which we will assess the following in a quantitative manner in the intervention group:

* Acceptability of chlorhexidine
* Reported use of chlorhexidine versus handwashing hardware
* Behavioral determinants of hand hygiene We will collect qualitative data from a subset of mothers in the intervention arm to understand in-depth about barriers and motivators to chlorhexidine use for hand cleansing at the conclusion of all quantitative data collection.","International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh",OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,300.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,PREVENTION,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Thus, medicine is often administered to maintain blood pressure but it is unclear at what level blood pressure should be aimed at during anesthesia.

Thirty patients undergoing major abdominal surgery will be included. The study will start one hour after the start of surgery and lasts for approximately half an hour. The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether blood flow to the brain can be increased by maintaining blood pressure at a higher level than that used in clinical practice. In the study, MAP is adjusted to a high, moderate, and low level for a short time. The low level of blood pressure used in the study, corresponds to the level aimed at in clinical practice. The drug noradrenaline will be used to control blood pressure. Blood flow to the brain will be evaluated on the neck using ultrasound.","Background Propofol anesthesia reduces cerebral blood flow (CBF) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) but it is unclear whether the decrease in CBF is accentuated by hypotension. Cerebral autoregulation is generally considered to maintain CBF when MAP is between 60-150 mmHg. Hence, vasoactive medication is administered if MAP decreases to below approximately 60 mmHg.

It is controversial whether there is a plateau for cerebral autoregulation. Thus, middle cerebral artery blood velocity (MCA Vmean), as an index of CBF, is associated to MAP during pharmacological changes in MAP between approximately 40-125 mmHg. Similarly, CBF is affected by pharmacological changes in MAP between 40-80 mmHg during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass surgery in propofol anesthesia. Arterial hypertension may increase the lower limit of cerebral autoregulation which can be mitigated by antihypertensive treatment.

Cognitive dysfunction and delirium are common following major surgery, particularly in the elderly, and may be related to hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion. Further, hypotensive anesthesia is associated with an increase in markers of neuronal damage, but studies have been too small to detect any difference in incidence of cognitive dysfunction following hypotensive as compared to normotensive anesthesia.

In young healthy adults, propofol anesthesia causes limited reduction in blood pressure and decreases CBF by approximately 50% by a reduction in neuronal activity. An increase in MAP from approximately 80 to 100 mmHg during propofol anesthesia does not affect CBF but it is unknown whether CBF can be increased by an increase in MAP from approximately 60 to 80 mmHg. Propofol appears to maintain cerebral autoregulation but it is unknown whether the lower level of cerebral autoregulation is affected. The internal carotid artery supplies most of CBF and dilates during moderate hypotension with maintained blood flow which indicates that the vessel contributes to cerebral autoregulation. Further, central blood volume and cardiac output may be important factors for maintaining CBF.

The study will include thirty patients planned for major abdominal surgery in propofol-remifentanil anesthesia combined with epidural analgesia. Internal carotid artery blood flow will be evaluated on the neck using duplex ultrasound. The study will be conducted one hour after the start of surgery and lasts for approximately half an hour. In the study, MAP is set pharmacologically at 80-85, 70-75 and 60-65 mmHg for a short time in random order. The level of 60-65 mmHg corresponds to the level at which MAP is maintained in clinical practice. Control of MAP is by intravenous infusion of noradrenaline, an α- and β-adrenergic agonist.

Objective The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether internal carotid artery blood flow is increased by maintaining MAP at a higher level than that used in clinical practice. Further, we evaluate whether a lower limit of cerebral autoregulation can be detected by comparing the slopes of linear regression of internal carotid artery blood flow and MAP at the evaluations when MAP is 60-65 and 70-75 mmHg and when MAP is 70-75 and 80-85 mmHg.

Hypotheses

* Internal carotid artery blood flow is higher when MAP is 80-85 mmHg as compared to a MAP of 60-65 mmHg.
* Internal carotid artery blood flow is higher when MAP is 70-75 mmHg as compared to a MAP of 60-65 mmHg.
* Internal carotid artery blood flow is higher when MAP is 80-85 mmHg as compared to a MAP of 70-75 mmHg.
* The slope of linear regression between changes in MAP and internal carotid artery blood flow is higher for the evaluations at a MAP of 70-75 and 60-65 mmHg than for the evaluations at a MAP of 80-85 and 70-75 mmHg.

Methods The study is a single-center, prospective cohort study of thirty consecutive patients planned for major abdominal surgery in propofol anesthesia. In case surgery is cancelled, or if gas anesthesia is used the patient will be excluded and excluded patients will be replaced. The number of drop-outs is expected to be between zero to five patients. Patients will be recruited the day before surgery, at which time the internal carotid artery will be evaluated using ultrasound. In case the vessel cannot be visualized, e.g. due to high localization of the carotid bifurcation the patient will not be able to participate in the study.

Anesthesia and surgery are according to clinical practice. Anesthesia is induced by propofol and maintained by propofol and remifentanil. A thoracic epidural catheter is placed at Th8/9 or Th9/10 and epidural anesthesia is initiated before surgery by bupivacaine infusion 0.5%, 5 ml/hr. and bolus 15 mg bupivacaine that is repeated hourly. Stroke volume is optimized after induction of anesthesia by repeated administration of 250 ml 5% human albumin until the increase in stroke volume is less than 10%, and volume optimization is repeated in case of persistent decrease in stroke volume by more than 10%. Noradrenaline infusion (0.6 µg/kg\*ml) is started after induction of anesthesia to maintain MAP above 60 mmHg and to avoid volume optimization when the circulation is dilated.

Development of a so-called mesenteric traction syndrome can affect MAP in the first hour of major abdominal surgery. Thus, the study is conducted from 60 min after incision and lasts for approximately half an hour. Anesthesia reduces MAP, but the reduction varies between patients and is affected by administration of propofol, remifentanil, and epidural anesthesia, fluid status, and surgical stimulation etc. The start of the study is postponed until any larger bleeding, transfusion or volume optimization is treated or finished. Before the start of the study, the infusion speed of propofol and remifentanil must have been constant for at least 10 min, and at least 15 min must have elapsed since the last bolus dose bupivacaine, as any changes in anesthesia may affect both cerebral and central hemodynamics. In case the infusion of propofol or remifentanil is changed or bolus bupivacaine is administered during the study, the experiment is halted, and the study is restarted when the anesthesia has been stable for 10 min. The experiment can only be restarted once and only data from the last trial with the highest number of evaluations are used.

In the experiment MAP is temporally set to 80-85, 70-75, and 60-65 mmHg by adjusting the infusion of noradrenaline. The order of evaluations is randomized by drawing an envelope just before the start of the experiment. Noradrenaline is short lasting and have no direct effect on CBF. The experiment lasts approximately 30 min until evaluations have been conducted at the three levels of MAP. If MAP does not drop to 60-65 mmHg by halting the infusion of noradrenaline this evaluation is not conducted but we expect that this will be the case in only few patients. In clinical practice noradrenaline is used to maintain MAP \> 60 mmHg. The study is not an investigation of medicinal products as noradrenaline is used as a tool to control MAP.

Administration of noradrenaline is by a central venous or large peripheral catheter, using an electronic infusion pump, and infusion speed is adjusted slowly until the level of MAP is reached. Noradrenaline is effective within 1-2 min after administration and the effect lasts only for a few minutes. When MAP has been stable at the desired level for at least 3 min, measurements are conducted during the following 2 min. When the study is finished, control of MAP will be according to clinical practice. We consider that there is no increased risk by a short term increase in MAP to 80-85 mmHg.

Measurements Arterial and central venous pressure are determined invasively while stroke volume, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance are evaluated by modified pulse-contour analysis of the arterial pressure curve (Nexfin, BMEYE, Holland). Cerebral and biceps muscle oxygenation are evaluated using near-infrared spectroscopy (INVOS 5100C, Somanetics, Troy, MI, USA). Depth of anesthesia is assessed by Bispectral Index (BIS Complete Monitoring Systems, Covidien, USA).

Internal carotid artery blood flow is evaluated unilaterally on the neck using duplex ultrasound (Logiq E, GE Medical System, Jiangsu, Kina). Evaluation is in the longitudinal section at least 1.5 cm distal to the carotid bifurcation with the head turned approximately 30⁰ to the contralateral side. In order to limit the influence of ventilation, three recordings of approximately 15-20 s are conducted at each level of MAP and the mean is reported. A frequency of 8-12 MHz is used and gain is set as high as possible while vessel lumen is echo-free. Ultrasonic adjustments are not changed during the study. Diameter is assessed using automatic software to track the vessel wall (Brachial Analyser for Research v. 6, Medical Imaging Applications LLC, Coralville, IA, USA). The angle-corrected time maximum flow velocity (TAVMAX) is evaluated using pulsed-wave Doppler at an angle of insonation ≤ 60º. The TAVMAX corresponds to twice the mean blood velocity and blood flow is: 0.125\*60\*TAVMAX\*π\*diameter\^2. Arterial and central venous blood is sampled for gas analysis and internal carotid artery blood flow is corrected for changes in PaCO2 using a factor of 3%/mmHg.

Statistics Trial size: The minimal clinically important difference in internal carotid artery blood flow between evaluations at MAP 60-65 and 80-85 mmHg is considered to be 10% as evaluations using near-infrared spectroscopy indicate that intraoperative cerebral deoxygenation of \> 10% associates to postoperative cognitive function.

A power calculation indicated that at least 18 patients were required to detect a difference in internal carotid artery blood flow of 10% corresponding to 19 ml/min assuming a standard deviation for the change of 27 ml/min (unpublished results from the study ""Cerebral Blood Flow During Propofol Anaesthesia"" NCT02951273) to obtain a 5% significance level and a power of 80%.

Over half of diabetic patients who develop a single ulcer will subsequently develop another ulcer of which the majority will become chronic non-healing ulcers. Over the past decade, the outcomes for patients with ulcers have not improved, despite advances in wound care.These data suggest the importance and necessity of alternative and more effective treatment option for diabetic patients with non-healing ulcers. (Blumberg et al 2012). Stem cell therapy has emerged as a novel therapeutic approach for various diseases including wound repair and tissue regeneration. Mesenchymal stem cells(MSCs) represent an important stem cell population with multipotent capabilities that may have high utility for translational clinical applications. MSCs can differentiate into a variety of cell types, especially fascia originated cells, and provide soluble factors for regeneration of tissues and organs(Şener et al 2015). Adipose tissue is an abundant source of mesenchymal stem cells, which have shown an improved outcome in wound healing studies. Adipose tissue derived stem cells (ASCs )are pluripotent stem cells with the ability to differentiate into different lineages and to secrete paracrine factors initiating tissue regeneration process. The abundant supply of fat tissue, ease of isolation, extensive proliferative capacities ex vivo, and their ability to secrete pro-angiogenic growth factors make them an ideal cell type to use in therapies for the treatment of nonhealing wounds(Hassan et al 2014), However the hostile microenviroment may interfere with viability and efficiency of MSCs injection specially in ischemic tissue , thus increasing needs for new strategies for further improvement of the stem cell therapy of diabetic wounds.

Pancreatic cancer, characterized by its aggressive nature and dismal prognosis, exhibits one of the lowest 5-year survival rates among all solid tumors, standing at a mere 7%. Alarming projections suggest that by the year 2030, it will ascend to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths. This dire scenario is further compounded by the stealthy onset of the disease, with an overwhelming 80-85% of patients already presenting with unresectable pancreatic cancer at the time of initial diagnosis.

Clinical trials have endeavored to extend the survival of this challenging patient subset through the administration of chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. While these interventions have shown some promise, the overall response rate remains disappointingly low, and patients continue to grapple with a bleak prognosis, often surviving less than a year. This unmet medical need underscores the critical demand for more effective therapeutic modalities in the management of pancreatic cancer, as the lack of viable treatment options remains a primary driver of its high mortality rate.

The traditional therapeutic landscape for unresectable pancreatic cancer primarily relies on single-agent chemotherapy. However, there is a growing realization within the medical community that a paradigm shift toward a multidisciplinary approach is imperative. The crux of achieving long-term survival for pancreatic cancer patients lies in the attainment of a durable anti-tumor response.

Targeted PD-(L)1 immunotherapy, renowned for its ability to induce enduring anti-tumor responses by harnessing the body's own immune system, has yielded remarkable results in various malignancies. Paradoxically, the success of single-agent immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer has been elusive, a phenomenon possibly attributed to the tumor's intrinsic genetic mutations and the hostile, immunosuppressive microenvironment that envelops pancreatic tumors.

Radiation therapy has emerged as a potential ally in this battle against pancreatic cancer. It has been demonstrated to augment the release of tumor-associated antigens, thereby priming the immune system for a more robust response. In response to the resistance encountered with PD-(L)1 monotherapy, researchers have embarked on a journey of preclinical and clinical investigations aimed at validating the combinatorial approach of PD-(L)1 inhibitors alongside chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

The fundamental premise underlying the synergy of radiation and immunotherapy is rooted in the non-invasive initiation of the immune system against tumor cells. Radiation serves as a catalyst, promoting antigen presentation and co-stimulation, culminating in the generation of an immune response targeted at epitopes that had remained concealed within distant metastases. Immune checkpoint inhibitors play a pivotal role in reversing the immunosuppressive effects of the tumor microenvironment, thereby fostering a milieu conducive to anti-tumor immunity.

While the efficacy of this integrative approach remains uncharted territory, current recommendations advocate for a first-line treatment strategy consisting of chemotherapy with optional radiation therapy. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy are not currently included in the initial treatment regimen. Consequently, the primary aim of our study is to explore and elucidate the outcomes of combining Sintilimab with radiation therapy and chemotherapy in the treatment of unresectable pancreatic cancer, offering a glimmer of hope in a landscape fraught with challenges and adversity.",Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,25.0,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,Sintilimab Plus Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy,TREATMENT,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is an established, efficient and safe technique for providing postoperative analgesia and has been associated with better pain relief and patient satisfaction with less postoperative complications and side effects \[1\]. Despite years of advances in pain management, opioids have been the mainstay for treatment of postoperative pain particularly in moderate to severe pain. Of all opioids, morphine is the most studied drug and remains the drug of choice for PCA, especially in Malaysian hospitals. However, morphine usage is also associated with known side effects such as sedation, nausea and vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention and respiratory depression \[2\]. A review of 32 studies involving opioids-based PCA-22 of which were PCA morphine-reported an incidence of 19% nausea, 18.1% vomiting, 30.9 % of nausea and/or vomiting, 25.7% sedation, 17.9% urinary retention, 17.9% pruritus and 15.2% hypoxia and 1.6% respiratory depression that may be life-threatening associated with PCA opioids use \[3, 4\]. The concept of multimodal analgesia hence was introduced to reduce opioid-related side effects. Adjuvants such as acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used nowadays in combination with opioids as opioid-sparing agents to reduce opioid usage \[5\].

Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, has undergone a recent resurgence of interest among acute care providers as an adjunct in acute pain management \[6, 7\]. Ketamine at a sub-anesthetic dose (0.2-0.5 mg kg-1) produces intense analgesia \[5, 8\]. Since its development in 1962, various studies have been conducted to prove the efficacy of ketamine as post-operative analgesia and as an opioid-sparing agent \[8-10\]. A review by Laskowski and colleagues described that IV ketamine improved the quality of pain control, in addition to decreased opioid consumption with the particular benefit being observed in painful procedures, such as upper abdominal, thoracic, and major orthopedic surgeries \[11\]. While Carstensen and co-workers in a qualitative review comparing PCA ketamine-morphine with PCA morphine alone also described the superior efficacy of ketamine-morphine in providing pain control with a significantly higher incidence of opioid-related side effects in the morphine group \[12\]. In comparison to opioids, ketamine's lack of respiratory depressant effects also favors its use as an opioid adjunct in patients with airway and respiratory compromise, especially in morbid obesity and post-thoracotomy patients \[13, 14\].

Despite the potential efficacy with published evidence of PCA ketamine-morphine in postoperative pain management, its use is not well established in most Malaysian hospitals including the current study site. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of PCA ketamine-morphine in comparison to conventional PCA morphine alone as postoperative analgesia in colorectal surgery patients in the current study site.

METHODS

This prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in Hospital Sultanah Aminah Johor Bahru from February to October 2018 after obtaining ethics approval from the local and institutional ethics committee (NMRR-17-1863-37291 \& JEP-2018-092). Sixty elective American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) I or II patients scheduled for lower midline laparotomy colorectal surgery aged between 18-70 years old were recruited and informed consents were obtained. Patients with a known allergy to morphine or ketamine, uncontrolled hypertension, past history of chronic pain on regular analgesics, psychiatric illness on psychiatric drugs, BMI more than 35 and creatine clearance less than 30 were excluded from the study. All patients who consented were taught the usage of a PCA machine and the potential side effects of ketamine and morphine preoperatively. They were randomly allocated into either Group A or Group B by computer-generated randomization a day before planned surgery.

Group A received PCA ketamine (Ketamine HCl, Pfizer Inc., US) 0.5 mg plus morphine 0.5 mg ml-1 (ratio 1:1) while Group B received PCA morphine (Pfizer Inc., US) 1 mg ml-1 as postoperative analgesia. There was no baseline infusion and the lock-out period was set to 5 minutes. The study drugs were prepared one day before the surgery by the pharmacist who was not involved in the intraoperative and post-=operative management of the patients. The drugs were labelled as study drugs with the study number. The patients, nurses who cared for the patients, the anesthetist who performed the anesthesia and the investigators who gathered the data were blinded to patients' group allocation.

All patients had standard monitoring of blood pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG), oxygen saturation and end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO2). They were pre-oxygenated with 100% oxygen for 2-3 minutes. The induction of general anesthesia was standardized to intravenous (IV) fentanyl (Cephalon Inc., US) 2 mcg kg-1, IV propofol (Diprivan, Pfizer Inc., US) 2 mg kg-1 and IV rocuronium (US) 0.6 mg kg-1 and intubation with the appropriate size of the endotracheal tube. Anesthesia was maintained with desflurane (Suprane, Novartis AG, Switzerland) in a mixture of 50% of oxygen and 50% of air, and titrated to achieve a minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of 1.0. All patients received IV dexamethasone (US) 8 mg after induction and IV morphine 0.1 mg kg-1 as intraoperative analgesia. Boluses of IV fentanyl 25 mcg were given if extra analgesia was required and recorded. IV ondansetron (US) 4 mg was given upon initiation of skin closure. The skin incision site was infiltrated with 0.25% Bupivacaine (US) 10-20 ml during skin closure. The standard dose of IV neostigmine and IV atropine was used to reverse residual neuromuscular blockade at the end of surgery.

At the recovery bay, pain score was assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), by which patients scored their pain intensity between number 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain at all and 10 being the worst pain imaginable. If the pain score was \> 4 at rest, IV morphine boluses were given and titrated according to the pre-set morphine protocol until the pain score was ≤ 4. PCA machine with the study drug(s) was commenced once the pain score was ≤ 4 at rest.

Patients were assessed 30 minutes after the commencement of PCA, at 6 hourly intervals for the first 24 hours and subsequently at 12 hourly intervals for the next 24 hours post-operatively by the Acute Pain Service (APS) team. They were solely on PCA as post-operative analgesia as the patients were kept nil by mouth for the first 48 hours postoperatively. All patients were assessed for pain score, sedation score, respiratory rate and other side effects of morphine and ketamine including nausea and vomiting, pruritus, dizziness and hallucinations. If the pain score was \> 4 at rest during the assessment, 2 ml of PCA drug was given as boluses and titrated every 10 minutes to achieve a pain score ≤ 4.

Cumulative morphine consumption was also recorded. Sedation was assessed using Pasero Opioid-Induced Sedation Scale (POSS) (S - sleep, easy to arouse, 1 - awake and alert, 2 - slightly drowsy, easy to arouse, 3 - frequently drowsy, arousable, drift to sleep during the conversation, 4 - somnolent, minimal or no response to verbal or physical stimulation). Treatment for nausea, vomiting and pruritus was given as deemed appropriate and recorded. At 48-hour post-operation, the patient's overall satisfaction score was assessed using 1 to 5 Likert scale (1 - very unsatisfied, 2 - unsatisfied, 3 - neutral, 4 - satisfied and 5 - very satisfied). If patients experience hallucinations or delirium, PCA bolus dose was reduced by 0.2 ml and the symptoms were reassessed after 1 hour. If symptoms persist, the PCA bolus dose was reduced further by 0.2 ml every hour until symptoms disappear and PCA subsequently continued at the reduced dose.

Patients with complicated surgeries in which they became haemodynamically unstable and required post-operative ICU admission, developed anaphylaxis after commencement of study drugs, developed persistent delirium or hallucination after reduction of PCA bolus dose and pain was uncontrollable with the reduced dose or those who refused to continue with the study for any reasons were withdrawn from the study and given other means of analgesia as appropriate by the acute pain service (APS) team.

The sample size was calculated using 'Power and Sample Size Calculations' program. The sample size was estimated using t-test calculation as derived from mean pain score and standard deviation as quoted in a study by Javery and colleagues \[15\]. The α value was set at 0.05 and power of study at 90% and standard deviation at 1.67, whereby it was estimated that 27 patients were required for each group. Anticipating a 10% drop-out rate, 30 patients were eventually recruited in each group, resulting in 60 patients for the whole study.

All data were analyzed using the SPSS (Statistical Package for The Social Sciences) software. Chi-square test or Fisher exact test was used when appropriate to calculate any significant differences for categorical variables. Independent t-test or Mann Whitney U test was used as appropriate to determine any significant differences for continuous variables. The incidence of side effects between the two groups was compared using Chi-square test. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre,OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,60.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,"Participants were randomly allocated into either Group A or Group B by computer-generated randomization a day before planned surgery.

d89bbdda806d5130,NCT04305717,Use of ReDS Technology in Patients With Acute Heart Failure,Remote Dielectric Sensing (ReDS) for a SAFE Discharge in Patients With Acutely Decompensated Heart Failure: The ReDS-SAFE HF Study,,GCO 19-2678,"Background: Fluid overload, especially pulmonary congestion, is one of the main contributors into heart failure (HF) readmission risk and it is a clinical challenge for clinicians. The Remote dielectric sensing (ReDS) system is a novel electromagnetic energy-based technology that can accurately quantify changes in lung fluid concentration noninvasively. Previous non-randomized studies suggest that ReDS-guided management has the potential to reduce readmissions in HF patients recently discharged from the hospital.

Aims: To test whether a ReDS-guided strategy during HF admission is superior to the standard of care during a 1-month follow up.

Methods: The ReDS-SAFE HF trial is an investigator-initiated, single center, single blind, 2-arm randomized clinical trial, in which \~240 inpatients with acutely decompensated HF at Mount Sinai Hospital will be randomized to a) standard of care strategy, with a discharge scheme based on current clinical practice, or b) ReDS-guided strategy, with a discharge scheme based on specific target value given by the device on top of the current clinical practice. ReDS tests will be performed for all study patients, but results will be blinded for treating physicians in the ""standard of care"" arm. The primary outcome will be a composite of unplanned visit for HF that lead to the use of intravenous diuretics, hospitalization for worsening HF, or death from any cause at 30 days after discharge. Secondary outcomes including the components of the primary outcome alone, length of stay, quality of life, time-averaged proportional change in the natriuretic peptides plasma levels, and safety events as symptomatic hypotension, diselectrolytemias or worsening of renal function.

Conclusions: The ReDS-SAFE HF trial will help to clarify the efficacy of a ReDS-guided strategy during HF-admission to improve the short-term prognosis of patients after a HF admission.","Heart failure (HF) is an increasing epidemic and a major public health priority, affecting more than 6 million patients in the United States of America (1). Specially, acutely decompensated HF (ADHF) is the most common cause of hospitalization in adults older than 65 years, and is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in pharmacological treatment and early follow-up programs in HF patients, readmission rates remain unacceptably high (2).

Fluid overload is a key feature in the pathophysiology of ADHF and residual congestion at the time of hospital discharge is one of the main contributors into readmission risk (3-5). Typically, fluid overload has been assessed through symptoms and signs, as well as other tools such as chest X-ray, plasma biomarkers, and echocardiography (6). However, these methods are subject to significant inter-observer variability and can be unreliable for various reasons. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that overt signs of clinical congestion correlate poorly with hemodynamic congestion assessed by invasive means. In recent years, invasive hemodynamic measurements to inform medical management of congestion facilitated by implantable pulmonary artery pressure sensors have been shown to reduce HF readmissions (7). Unfortunately, due to its invasive nature as well as reimbursement and insurance coverage issues, its widespread adoption has been limited.

Thus, the use of a non-invasive assessment of volume status to guide HF management and identify a state of ""euvolemia"" is an attractive tool, particularly during admission and early phase after discharge, which is a vulnerable period for recurrent congestion (8). The Remote dielectric sensing (ReDS) system is a novel electromagnetic energy-based technology that can accurately quantify changes in lung fluid concentration noninvasively (9). Though limited experience from non-randomized studies suggest that ReDS-guided management has the potential to reduce readmissions in ADHF patients recently discharged from the hospital (10, 11), nevertheless data to substantiate the employment of such as strategy is lacking. The study team hypothesizes that a ReDS-guided strategy to measure the percent of lung water volume as a surrogate of congestion during HF hospitalization will help to determine the appropriate timing of discharge and will accordingly be associated with a better short-term prognosis.",Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,240.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,"The ReDS-SAFE HF trial is a 2-arm randomized clinical trial, in which inpatients with ADHF will be randomized to:

The trial is a pilot study of 20 cases","The study is for patients undergoing elective primary knee replacement surgery under spinal anaesthesia. It is proposed that using music played on noise cancelling headphones will reduce the requirements for intravenous sedation in a randomised controlled trial of twenty patients. Spinal anaesthesia is commonly used for knee replacement. It provides loss of feeling from the operated limb but the patient remains awake. Orthopaedic surgery is very noisy. It is usual for patients to receive intravenous sedation with midazolam to reduce their awareness of surgery. Intravenous midazolam is effective but it depresses both the breathing and the circulation and may cause low blood pressure and reduced oxygenation. It is expected that by using noise cancelling headphones to reduce the awareness of noise during surgery, there will be a reduced requirement for intravenous midazolam. The study will measure the dose of midazolam required by patients randomised to receive either noise cancelling headphones playing music (intervention) or no headphones (control group). Patients will be followed up prior to hospital discharge to assess their awareness and recall of intra operative events and their satisfaction with intravenous sedation. This is a novel application of sound reducing technology capable of improving the patient experience during surgery whilst potentially reducing complications of intravenous midazolam sedation. Noise cancelling technology is readily available in commercially available headphones and it has the potential to eliminate background noise of surgical procedures.

Early identification and treatment of HCV during the acute phase can result in significantly higher response rates with shorter durations of therapy.

Pegylated-interferon alfa (PEG-IFN) was the typical treatment for HCV infection. Participants subcutaneously inject PEG-IFN where the average duration of treatment was approximately 20 weeks. With the advancement of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs), it was possible to see if a new DAA might be non-inferior compared to (PEG-IFN).

The study was designed to see if a fixed-dose combination tablet can replace the old HCV treatments by being more effective, safer and better tolerated in HIV-infected participants with new HCV infection. The study was a Phase I, open-label, two cohort clinical trial, in which 44 acutely HCV-infected HIV-1 positive participants were enrolled. Participants in each cohort were evaluated in two steps: on treatment (Step 1) and follow-up after discontinuing study treatment (Step 2). The cohorts were enrolled sequentially. Participants in Cohort 1 were enrolled and administered oral Sofosbuvir (SOF) in combination with weight-based ribavirin (RBV). Participants in Cohort 2 were enrolled and administered an oral fixed dose combination of Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF).","The first cohort opened with SOF/RBV treatment for 12 weeks and accrued 17 participants. All participants under Cohort 1 were to visit the clinical site at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 when on treatment (Step 1), then visit the clinical site again at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks during follow-up after discontinuing study treatment (Step 2).

The second cohort opened for an 8-week treatment of LDV/SOF and included at least 27 subjects. All participants under Cohort 2 were to visit the clinical site at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 when on treatment (Step 1), then visit the clinical site again at 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks during follow-up after discontinuing study treatment (Step 2).

Both cohorts were monitored for safety and HCV viral load response while the participants were on treatment.

The primary objective did not compare the cohorts together; instead, each study cohort was formally assessed for efficacy with sustained virologic response 12 weeks after treatment based on non-inferiority criteria compared to a historical SVR rate of 60% separately.",Advancing Clinical Therapeutics Globally for HIV/AIDS and Other Infections,NETWORK,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,44.0,NON_RANDOMIZED,SINGLE_GROUP,,TREATMENT,,,NONE,,,"A5327 Eligibility Criteria (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2)

All groups will be followed for washout.

Data gathered from this study will be used to establish novel dosing strategies and provide insights into the incorporation of n-3 PUFAs in different tissues and their washout in young and older participants.","Skeletal muscle is crucial for health and accounts for approximately 40% of total body mass. A loss of skeletal muscle mass is seen in the process of ageing, with reductions between 0.2%-0.5% of muscle mass per year starting in the fifth decade. Accelerated loss of muscle and function above a certain threshold is characterized as sarcopenia. Age-related sarcopenia is prevalent in the UK; it is estimated to affect 4.6% men and 7.9% women with an average age of 67 years. Older people have an impaired capacity to increase muscle protein synthesis (MPS) rates in response to protein intake; this is thought to be a key contributor to age-related sarcopenia. Therefore, it is essential to elucidate new strategies to prevent and treat the accelerated loss of muscle mass and function.

Omega (ω)-polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) derived from fish oil have possible beneficial effects on health. Evidence suggests potential therapeutic effects of n-3 PUFAs in maintenance/prevention of loss of skeletal muscle mass. N-3 PUFAs probably exert their effects by incorporation into tissue membranes. However, the relation between dose and incorporation into tissue membranes is unclear. Interestingly, a higher dose ingested over 4 weeks seen by McGlory et al. induced similar omega-3 incorporation in the tissue compared to the low doses over 8 weeks studied by Smith et al. If higher doses change tissue composition earlier, then there will be earlier benefits for muscle health and function. Thus, there is a need to examine whether an initial loading dose incorporation into tissues can be sustained by moving to a lower maintenance feeding dose. Furthermore, the exact molecular mechanisms of how n-3 PUFAs act on skeletal muscle are unclear. Several metabolic and molecular responses are affected, but wherein these pathways n-3 PUFAs act remain largely unknown and requires more investigation, with a focus on long-term settings.

This study aims to tackle these problems by executing a 5-month study where we will track the incorporation and washout of n-3 PUFAs into different tissues following two different dosing strategies in healthy young and older volunteers. Data gathered from this study will be used to establish novel dosing strategies and provide insights into the incorporation of n-3 PUFAs in different tissues and their washout in young and older participants. Ultimately, these insights will help targeting, prevention, and treatment of sarcopenia.

To do so, the investigators will enroll approximately 1300 adult smokers with SMI who receive psychiatric rehabilitation services, Community Based Flexible Support (CBFS) or Assertive Community Treatment (ACT)), from the two largest providers of these services in the Boston area. Primary care clinics that serve 3 or more enrolled participants will be cluster randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either receive AD for their clinical staff or treatment as usual (TAU) in a cluster randomized design. Smokers with SMI in the study who receive primary care at the clinics assigned to the AD intervention to providers will be randomly assigned at the individual level in a 1:1 ratio to be offered CHW support in addition to their ongoing psychiatric rehabilitation (CBFS or ACT) services. This was the original design for the study and these participants comprise Cohort 1. The protocol was modified and approved by the sponsor in February 2018 to include a second cohort. Because 155 enrolled participants received primary care in 155 clinics that served only 1-2 participants, and it was beyond the scope of the trial to deliver AD to so many clinics, a second cohort was formed in which these 155 participants were randomly assigned at the individual level in a 1:1 ratio to CHW or TAU.

This study was also modified by receipt of a qualitative supplement award from the sponsor to conduct mixed methods research to identify and define barriers and facilitators to implementation of components of the integrated care intervention in primary care clinical settings using an interactive convergent mixed-methods design. The aim of this portion of the study is to better understand the factors that impact the integration of Integrated Care and evidence-based treatments for smoking cessation for those with SMI in primary care settings.

Many patients fail to achieve complete remission of symptoms under antidepressant medication, with about 10% of patients being chronically resistant to several psychopharmacological treatments. Development of alternative non-pharmacological treatments is therefore essential to improve patient care.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) offers therapeutic potential in this context. Current protocols apply high-frequency rTMS over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) to reverse the increased alpha-band oscillatory activity and cortical hypo-excitability in patients with depression. However, translation of rTMS therapy into routine clinical practice has been limited due to low efficacy and high inter-individual variability.

This study aims to optimize rTMS stimulation protocols for MDD by deterministically coupling the timing of TMS to the ongoing oscillatory neural activity in the underlying cortex as measured in real-time with high-density surface EEG. It is hypothesized that alpha phase-locked rTMS of the left DLPFC reverses increased alpha-band oscillatory activity and cortical hypo-excitability more efficiently than current open-loop rTMS protocols used in the treatment of MDD.",University Hospital Tuebingen,OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,17.0,RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,,BASIC_SCIENCE,,,QUADRUPLE,,,"Subject inclusion criteria

653cdd57b0b64c68,NCT06685640,Comparison of Clinical Success of Stainless Steel Crowns and Zirconia Crowns in Primary Molars,Evaluation of Clinical Success and Parental Satisfaction of Prefabricated Stainless Steel Crowns and Zirconia Crowns Applied to Primary Molar Teeth,,AADÜDHF 2023/36,"Evaluation and understanding of clinical success, parental satisfaction and effects on periodontal tissues are the main expected benefits of prefabricated zirconia crowns and prefabricated stainless steel crowns. For a long time, stainless steel crowns have been the restorative material of choice for children's primary and permanent posterior teeth. Today, prefabricated zirconia crowns are more popular than other options because they meet aesthetic expectations and have high mechanical strength. The aim of this study is to evaluate and compare the periodontal health, plaque accumulation, opposing tooth wear, parental satisfaction, and clinical performance (color match, retention, marginal integrity, marginal discoloration, anatomic form, secondary caries, surface roughness, surface gloss and postoperative sensitivity) of pediatric prefabricated stainless steel and zirconia crowns applied after pulpotomy to asymptomatic, multifaceted, deep carious primary mandibular second molars.","MATERIALS AND METHODS/RESEARCH TECHNIQUES:

Material:

In the study, two different prefabricated crowns will be applied to the right and left primary mandibular second molars after pulpotomy using a split-mouth design. One will be a prefabricated zirconia crown and the other will be a prefabricated stainless steel crown. The sample size was calculated by G\*Power analysis program as 12 teeth, 6 teeth in each group. Since this sample size would reduce the validity and reliability of future statistical tests, it was decided to conduct the study with a total of 20 samples, 10 in each group, taking into account possible data loss and the power of the study. Teeth will be randomly divided into two groups according to crown type.

The study will be terminated when the last visit of the last patient providing the sample is completed and the data is finalized.

Method:

* Before the treatment of primary mandibular second molars that meet the inclusion criteria, topical anesthesia (Vemcaine Pump Spray, VEM İlaç, Turkey) containing 10% lidocaine will be applied to the anesthesia area with a cotton pellet. After topical anesthesia, local anesthesia (Maxicaine Ampoule, VEM İlaç, Turkey) containing 40 mg articaine hydrochloride and 0.006 mg epinephrine hydrochloride in 1 ml will be administered.
* Then, the area will be cleaned under rubber dam isolation, and the coronal pulp will be removed. Hemostasis will be provided with a sterile cotton pellet moistened with serum for 5 minutes, and hemostasis will be achieved with ferric sulfate (ViscoStat™, Ultradent, Germany) for 15 seconds.
* The pulp chamber will be filled with MTA (NeoMTA Putty, NuSmile, TX, USA), then a 0.5 mm layer of resin-modified glass ionomer will be applied to the cavity floor, and the restoration will be completed with composite.
* The first step in applying stainless steel crowns will be to select the crown length. First, high-speed rotary tools will be used to prepare 1.5-2 mm occlusal reduction with diamond burs; a 1-2 mm subgingival preparation will be made from the gingival margin. The proximal surfaces will be reduced approximately 1 mm thick, starting from the occlusal and buccally, lingually, and gingivally from the mesial and distal contact points of the tooth.
* In order to achieve full adaptation to the tooth, after any necessary corrections, the crown edge will be curved with the help of forceps, and the edge will be trimmed with scissors or a bur until cervical adaptation is achieved. The shortened crown edges will be polished with the help of discs and rubbers.
* The teeth to be coated with zirconium will be prepared subgingivally from 2 mm occlusal and 1-2 mm from the gingival margin in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
* Since zirconia crowns are not flexible, the mesial and distal walls will be prepared parallel to the adjacent teeth, taking into account the distance to ensure passive adaptation.
* A conical diamond bur will be used in proximal reduction to ensure passive seating of the selected crown. The appropriate size crown will be found by trial.
* After the appropriate crown is selected for zirconia crowns, a cotton pellet moistened with sterile serum is applied to the area for 5 minutes to control bleeding, and the bleeding will be stopped. If necessary, bleeding control agents or retraction cords will be used to prevent active bleeding during cementation.
* The crowns in both groups are cemented with FujiCEM Evolve (GC, Tokyo, Japan). This cement in the RMCIS group is in paste form. It is applied directly into the crown in an injectable form with its own special tip and polymerized with a light device for 10 seconds. The cement residue accumulated at the gingival margin is cleaned with a probe, and a setting time of 4-5 minutes is waited in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Occlusion is checked. After the cementation is completed with the appropriate application technique, the cement residue accumulated at the gingival margin is cleaned with a probe tip. If a scratch occurs on the crowns during this process, this mark is cleaned with a bur, and the surface is polished with polishing discs.

In general, in the evaluation of success:

* Teeth that have been extracted due to abscess development in control appointments.
* Dissolution of cement and decementation of the crown.
* Internal and external root resorption seen in radiographic evaluation.
* Teeth with lesions in the furcation region.
* Teeth with widening in the periodontal ligament space will be evaluated as unsuccessful.

Plaque Index and Gingival Index in pediatric prefabricated stainless steel and zirconia crowns applied to asymptomatic primary mandibular second molars after pulpotomy will be evaluated at baseline and at the 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month follow-ups. Tooth Wear Index, Modified United States Public Health Service (USPHS) Criteria, and parental satisfaction will also be assessed at the 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month follow-ups.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of interleukin-7 in treating patients with metastatic melanoma or locally advanced or metastatic kidney cancer.","OBJECTIVES:

Primary

* Determine the safety of recombinant interleukin-7 (IL-7) in patients with metastatic melanoma or locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
* Confirm the previously documented safety profile of non-glycosylated IL-7 in these patients.
* Determine the safety of higher doses of recombinant IL-7 in these patients.
* Determine the maximum tolerated dose of recombinant IL-7 in these patients.
* Determine the biologically active dose of recombinant IL-7 in these patients.

However, SCD is still an increasing national health problem, with increase longevity the chronic effect of sustained hemolysis and episodic vaso-occlusive events and the recurrent episodes of ischemic reperfusion injury drive the development of progressive end organ complications and cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological and renal systems are most commonly affected. Today there is hope for a cure using hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, at present; the procedure is infrequently performed and very expensive. In this research we will assess the effect of implementation of the automated erythrocytapheresis in the outcome of sickle cell disease in single Egyptian center.","There is a wide scoop for treatment of SCD ranging from medical treatment with hydroxyurea, simple transfusion with chelation therapy, exchange transfusion either manual or automated and stem cell transplantation which need highly equipped institutes.

The goals of treatment of SCD are symptom control with early detection and management of disease complications. Although several pharmacological agents have been studied for the treatment of SCD, the only drug currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of SCD is hydroxyurea. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) can cure SCD, but it is difficult to decide which patients should be offered BMT. Many risks are associated with BMT, and the risk-to-benefit ratio must be assessed carefully. The lack of availability of a matched donor may limit the utility of BMT. Transfusions are not needed for the usual anemia or episodes of pain associated with SCD. Urgent replacement of blood is often required for sudden severe anemia and regular blood transfusions are used for primary and secondary stroke prevention in children with SCD. With continued transfusion, iron overload inevitably develops and can result in heart and liver failure, and multiple other complications necessitate the use of chelation therapy.

Erythrocytapheresis is an automated red cell exchange procedure that removes blood that contains HbS from the patient while simultaneously replacing that same volume with packed red cells free of HbS. Transfusion usually consists of sickle-negative, leuco-reduced, and phenotypically matched blood for red cell antigens. Erythrocytapheresis thus has the advantage of controlling iron accumulation in patients with SCD who undergo long-term transfusion, as well as the ability to allow rapid reduction of HbS concentrations to less than 30% without significantly increasing total hemoglobin concentration post transfusion. This precision is achieved because, before the start of the transfusion, the computer in the pheresis machine calculates the expected amount of packed RBCs required to obtain a specific post-transfusion hemoglobin level, using various physiologic parameters (eg, height, weight, Hb level). Further, erythrocytapheresis requires less time than simple transfusion of similar blood volumes. Although erythrocytapheresis is more expensive than simple transfusion, the additional costs associated with simple transfusions (ie, those of chelation and organ damage due to iron overload) make erythrocytapheresis more cost-effective than simple transfusion programs. Central venous access devices can safely be used for long-term erythrocytapheresis in patients with SCD with a low rate of complications.",Ain Shams University,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,20.0,NON_RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,TREATMENT,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

033088b0e1c2844d,NCT02488889,Effects of Varenicline in Heavy Drinking Smokers,,VAR,23FT-0102,This laboratory study will examine if varenicline can reduce alcohol-induced smoking lapse in heavy drinking smokers.,"There is a strong positive association between cigarette smoking and alcohol use both at the epidemiologic and behavioral levels. This co-use can create substantial impediments in smoking cessation. Approximately 25% of current smokers are heavy drinkers. Alcohol use is a risk factor for relapse during smoking cessation and is associated with lower odds of quitting smoking. Smokers are five times as likely to experience a smoking lapse during drinking episodes than at other times. Further, heavy drinking smokers experience more health consequences than individuals who are either only smokers or heavy drinkers, such as impairments in brain morphology and function and greater risk for various cancers. Given the high co-occurrence of smoking and drinking and the health risks associated with the co-use of these substances, it has been convincingly argued that heavy drinking smokers constitute a distinct sub-population of smokers with a unique clinical profile and treatment needs. Yet, there are no available pharmacological treatments or guidelines tailored to heavy drinking smokers, despite the evidence that this is a treatment-resistant sub-group. Thus, treatment development for heavy drinking smokers represents a highly significant and understudied research area. Varenicline is a first-line treatment for nicotine dependence that may also be effective in reducing alcohol use. Recent studies have indicated that varenicline reduces the pleasurable effects of alcohol and its self-administration in the laboratory, as well as alcohol craving and consumption in clinical trials. These findings suggest that varenicline is a promising medication for smoking cessation in heavy drinking smokers, as reducing alcohol craving and consumption may be a key component to effectively reducing smoking and preventing relapse in this sub-group.

In early abstinence, one of the most reliable predictors of relapse is the occurrence of a single smoking lapse, which is generally defined as smoking at least a puff of a cigarette. As much as 95% of smokers who experience a lapse will progress to relapse, which has led to the first lapse being theorized to represent the transition from abstinence to regular smoking. Alcohol consumption is one of the most consistently identified risk factors for a smoking lapse and, therefore, may contribute to the maintenance of nicotine dependence in heavy drinking smokers. Recent clinical trial and laboratory evidence suggests that varenicline is effective in reducing general smoking lapse behavior, although it is unknown whether this effect translates to alcohol-mediated smoking lapse behavior.

To address this important gap in the literature, this human laboratory study will use two laboratory paradigms, namely alcohol administration and a smoking lapse task, to examine clinically-relevant effects of varenicline among heavy-drinking smokers (i.e., individuals who smoke ≥ 10 cigarettes/day and who meet National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) guidelines for heavy drinking). The investigators will enroll 22 non-treatment seeking heavy drinking smokers in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover laboratory study, testing the efficacy of varenicline in reducing smoking behavior after controlled alcohol administration among heavy drinking smokers. All participants will be daily smokers (≥ 10 cig/day) who are also heavy drinkers according to NIAAA guidelines. Interested individuals will come in to the laboratory for an in-person screening visit and physical exam. Eligible participants will then be randomized to a medication sequence, varenicline (1 mg twice daily) or placebo. Medication will be titrated over a 12-day period and within each medication condition participants will complete two laboratory sessions on days 9 and 12. The laboratory sessions will consist of placebo-controlled alcohol administration followed by the McKee smoking lapse task. After completing both laboratory sessions for the first medication condition, and after a seven-day wash-out period, participants will be begin the second medication condition and again complete laboratory sessions on days 9 and 12 of the titration period (i.e., each participant will complete four laboratory sessions and experience all four combinations of varenicline/placebo pill and alcohol/placebo beverage). In each laboratory session, participants will receive a dose of alcohol \[target breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) = 0.08 g/dl\] or placebo beverage, in a randomized and double-blind fashion, and will then complete a smoking lapse task. In this paradigm, participants are presented with their preferred brand of cigarettes, a lighter, and an ashtray. Participants are then informed that they can begin a cigarette self-administration session or delay smoking in exchange for a fixed amount of monetary reinforcement. If the participant decides to smoke, they then begin the self-administration session in which they are again given the choice to smoke their preferred brand of cigarettes or receive a fixed monetary reinforcement for each cigarette that is not smoked. In addition to these smoking outcomes, measures of craving, mood, and subjective effects will be administered at baseline, after alcohol administration, and during the lapse paradigm. The study design allows for a within-subjects comparison of the effects of varenicline (versus placebo), alcohol (versus placebo), and their interaction on smoking behavior in the laboratory.

The Specific Aims of this project proposal are: Aim 1: To test whether varenicline is effective at reducing alcohol and cigarette craving, as well as reducing the acute subjective effects of alcohol and cigarettes; Aim 2: To test whether varenicline is effective at mitigating alcohol's effects on smoking lapse behavior; Aim 3: To test whether acute subjective response to alcohol is predictive of subsequent smoking lapse behavior and to examine if varenicline reduces this effect. The investigators hypothesize that varenicline, compared to placebo, will reduce cigarette and alcohol craving, attenuate subjective response to alcohol and cigarette smoking, and improve performance on the smoking lapse task by increasing the participant's ability to resist smoking. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that varenicline's ability to reduce alcohol craving and subjective response to an acute dose of alcohol will be directly predictive of performance on the smoking lapse task. Since heavy drinking smokers have been shown to be relatively treatment-resistant, the results of the current study could have sizable implications for supporting varenicline as a potential tailored treatment for this sizable and at-risk sub-group.","University of California, Los Angeles",OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,0.0,RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,,TREATMENT,,,TRIPLE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Among the various symptoms reported, fatigue stands out as a particularly burdensome and pervasive issue, significantly impacting the quality of life and daily functioning of Long Covid patients. Recent studies report that gut microbiota is altered during acute illness and not restored even after several months from recovery. Based on this evidence, modulation of intestinal microbiota can be considered as a possible therapeutic approach for Long Covid Syndrome.

85b31ff9ecc76c30,NCT05898789,Virtual Rehabilitation for Cancer Survivors,Pragmatic Hybrid Type 1 Effectiveness-implementation (E-I) Trial of a Virtual Cancer Rehabilitation Program,,22-6035,"Pragmatic hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation (E-I) trial of a virtual cancer rehabilitation program: The study team will conduct a multi-center hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation study to examine the clinical effectiveness and implementation potential of an 8-week multidimensional virtual cancer rehabilitation intervention (CaRE@Home) for cancer survivors with identified cancer-related impairments on level of overall disability (primary outcome) and patient reported physical and social functioning, anxiety, work status, quality of life, and physiologic changes (secondary outcomes). The study team will conduct a multi-centre pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) (Vancouver, Toronto, Saint John and St. John's) to evaluate effectiveness and using the CIFR, the study team will identify potential factors that may affect successful implementation and integration of CaRE@Home in different cancer settings.","Comprehensive multidimensional rehabilitation programs that include both exercise and self management education have the potential to concurrently improve a wide range of post treatment side-effects and overall patient function. In 2017, the Cancer Rehabilitation and Canadian Cancer Rehabilitation (CanRehab) Team: Improving the systematic identification, management, and treatment of the adverse effects of cancer.

Survivorship program at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre launched an evidence driven group based multidimensional Cancer Rehabilitation and Exercise program (CaRE@ELLICSR) for patients who have identified cancer-related impairments. The 8-week program integrates a number of evidence-based techniques to sustain behavioural change and consists of weekly1-hr group exercise classes followed by 1-hr self-management skills education delivered by a rehabilitation expert. Participants return for follow-up at 3 and 6 months post-intervention to monitor progress and adapt exercise as needed. CaRE@ELLICSR has resulted in improvements in overall levels of disability, social functioning, distress, and physical activity. Program satisfaction is high, and wait times are within the target of \<1 month. However, access is an issue with \~50% of referred patients unable to participate due to travel distance, transportation costs or competing obligations (unpublished data).

To increase access, a virtual on-line version of the CaRE program (CaRE@Home) was developed using a series of iterative steps proposed by the NCI Research-Tested Intervention Programs.

The CaRE@Home program is currently undergoing single-group feasibility pilot testing (completion Oct 2019, funded by Ontario Institute for Cancer Research). Feasibility outcomes collected to date demonstrate high program acceptability with 95% of referred patients enrolled and 94% program adherence. The final steps of this process are to formally evaluate effectiveness and prepare for real-world implementation, which is the focus of Project Two of this application. If effective, the virtual CaRE@Home program has the potential to extend access to critical cancer rehabilitation services to a greater number of cancer survivors in need. It also has immense potential to be adapted and scaled to other centres that lack the resources required to deliver in-house cancer rehabilitation services. In Project Two the study team will conduct a multi-center hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation study to examine the clinical effectiveness and implementation potential of CaRE@Home for cancer survivors with identified cancer-related impairments.

Principal Research Aims:

Aim 2.1: Test the effectiveness of CaRE@Home vs. usual care (UC) on disability (primary outcome) and patient reported and physiological outcomes (secondary outcomes) at 3-months post-intervention.

Aim 2.2: Conduct a descriptive implementation-focused process evaluation to inform future implementation efforts

Methods The project is a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation (E-I) study. The aim of hybrid trials are to better align research and practice and to provide a pathway for rapidly moving knowledge from research to implementation. In hybrid type 1 studies, the primary aim is to determine effectiveness in the setting where it will be implemented and the secondary aim is to better understand the context for implementation. This methodology promotes the study of implementation as early as possible in the research process and can serve a dual purpose in helping to explain effectiveness results and informing future implementation efforts.

Aim 2.1: Effectiveness evaluation of CaRE@Home (months 36-58) Design: The study team will conduct a multi-centre pragmatic RCT (Vancouver, Toronto, Saint John and St. John's) to evaluate effectiveness. Clinical effectiveness studies place a greater emphasis on external validity and generalizability than efficacy trials and typically include heterogeneous patient populations and settings. Participants will be randomized into CaRE@Home or UC.

Recruitment and Data Collection: Eligible participants will be identified by their oncology team, and provided information about the study along with contact information for the local study team. Depending on timing, the ePSM platform (Project One) may also be used to identify and invite potential participants. Interested patients will be pre-screened by telephone (eligibility tools above), and those who are eligible will be invited to an in-person baseline assessment (T1). Site-specific screening logs will be maintained. At the baseline assessment, participants will provide consent and complete PRO and physiological measures (see below) with a trained assessor. Following the assessment, the research assistant will obtain the randomization assignment. Those assigned to CaRE@Home will be registered into the CaRE@Home platform.

Follow-up assessment for both groups will occur at 8-weeks (T2 immediate post intervention) and 3 months post-intervention (T3). The CaRE@Home group will have an additional 6 months post-intervention (T4) to assess maintenance. Randomization: Permuted block randomization, with stratification by center and on/finished treatment will allocate participants to either CaRE@Home or UC. Randomization will be computer-generated and managed by the Department of Biostatistics at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre.

Description of Study Arms: i) Care@Home is an 8-week program comprised of: 1) weekly e-modules providing interactive education to promote self-management skills; 2) individualized progressive exercise prescription supported with mobile application (PhysitrackTM); 3) wearable technology (FitbitTM) to track activity and sleep; and 4) weekly brief telephone counselling with a member of the rehabilitation team (see Appendix 4 CaRE@Home program elements). Informed by behavior change theory, the program elements aim to provide patients with the knowledge and tools needed to reach and maintain their wellness and exercise goals. Training for health professionals: In person assessments and weekly phone calls will be delivered by a rehabilitation/exercise professional who has experience working with cancer survivors. The exercise professionals will receive comprehensive training and ongoing supervision. Training will be provided by a Motivational Interviewing Network of Trainers certified trainer (Dr. M. Obadia). The training will be videotaped and an online tool box with training resources will be developed to support future scalability. ii) UC will receive usual care and will be asked to complete in-person assessment at T2 and T3. Following T3 assessment, the UC group will be offered the CaRE@Home program.

Data analysis: Demographic and clinical information across all time points will be summarised using descriptive statistics and plotted across all time points. Effectiveness will be assessed on the full set of consented participants in accordance with the intention to treat principle. The primary outcome is the difference in WHODAS 2.0 mean score between CaRE@Home and UC at T3. Differences on secondary outcomes at T3 will also be compared between the two treatment arms using paired t test or paired Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Maintenance of treatment gains in the CaRE@Home group will be analyzed at T4. An estimate of the effect size and parameters and corresponding confidence intervals will be calculated between groups at T3 and over time (within groups). Variability of the main and interaction effects will be examined on the primary clinical outcome (WHODAS 2.0) and each of the secondary outcomes using separate longitudinal analysis models such as mixed model regression and generalized estimating equation models. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted, adjusting for important clinical factors using the regression model. Finally, a cost-utility analysis will be undertaken to estimate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) of the intervention arm compared to the control arm.

Sample Size: Our sample size calculations is based on 80% power with a two-sided alpha-level at 0.05 and an estimated effect size of 0.4 standard deviation of the primary endpoint.

Assuming attrition of up to 30% and adherence to be 80%, 388 patients will be recruited (or 194 patients per arm). The number of potentially eligible patients across sites is estimated to be 170 patients per month. Based on proposed staffing per site, a maximum of 20 patients can be enrolled per month in Toronto/Vancouver and 10 per site in NB/NFLD. Enrollment is estimated to take 6-7 months. The study team will use multiple strategies to promote retention and prevent attrition.

Aim 2.2: Implementation-focused Process Evaluation (months 30-52) Design: In order to inform the implementation of CaRE@Home, a process evaluation will be conducted and guided by the RE-AIM framework\[88\]. The CFIR will be used to examine context and understand relevant barriers and facilitators across and within CanRehab sites. See Table 3 for Implementation Framework/Process Evaluation Questions and Tools.

Data Collection Tools: Data tools will include interviews/focus groups, surveys, screening logs, observational notes, technical reports, infrastructure review to inform costs as well as staffing and infrastructure requirements. The study team will triangulate the data from the different quantitative and qualitative sources to answer questions developed based on elements of the selected frameworks and summarize our findings.

Data Analysis: Descriptive variables will be presented as means, distributions, and proportions with differences between subgroups compared. Qualitative information from open-ended survey questions, interviews, and research log entries will be transcribed and analyzed using common deductive qualitative analysis techniques\[133\] following the CFIR qualitative data analysis templates. Following this, all transcripts will be coded and additional inductive codes will be added.","University Health Network, Toronto",OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,388.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Secondary study outcomes relate to the same comparison, yet focus on clinical and patient-reported outcomes, soft tissue changes and aesthetic outcomes.

Methodology Inclusion and exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria are as follows: at least 20 years old; good oral hygiene defined as full-mouth plaque score ≤ 25% (O'Leary et al. 1972); presence of an incisor, cuspid or premolar in the maxilla that needs to be extracted for any reason with at least one neighboring tooth present; at least 3 mm bone available at the apical or palatal aspect of the alveolus as assessed on CBCT to ensure primary implant stability; intact buccal bone wall (type I) or limited buccal bone dehiscence (type IIa or IIb) at the time of extraction; written informed consent.

Exclusion criteria are as follows: pregnancy; systemic diseases; smoking; suppuration; \> 1 mm gingival asymmetry between the failing and contralateral tooth; untreated periodontal disease; untreated caries lesions.

Sample size calculation A recent RCT indicated successful regeneration at 1 mm below the implant shoulder in 82% of the cases treated with C-CTG (Cosyn et al., 2024). Since none of the alternative options augment hard and soft tissues at this level, it is expected that S-CTG as well as DZ achieve 50% less success. Using a two-sided Chi-square test, a sample size of 45 patients (15 in each group) would be needed to achieve such absolute risk difference between the control group and either test group (C-CTG versus S-CTG; C-CTG versus DZ) with at least 80% power at the 5% significance level. The sample size would be increased to 18 patients per group to compensate for possible drop-outs. The sample size calculation was performed using SPSS Statistics 28 (IBM, New York, USA).

Randomization, allocation concealment and blinding Patients will be randomly assigned to either C-CTG, S-CTG or DZ. Fifty-four sealed envelopes are prepared for that purpose, of which 18 are internally labeled as C-CTG, 18 as S-CTG and 18 as DZ. Following IIP, a sealed envelope will be opened to reveal the treatment concept. Group allocation will be revealed following implant installation and will remain concealed for the evaluating examiner and statistician to allow for unbiased registrations and analyses, respectively.

Surgical procedures All surgeries will be performed by two implant surgeons (JC, TDB) at Ghent University Hospital. Patients will be prescribed amoxicillin for 4 days (2 times 1 g per day started 1h before surgery), analgesics (ibuprofen 600 mg) as deemed necessary and oral disinfection (chlorhexidine rinse 2 times per day during one week). Irrespective of the group, a cutting implant (BLX, Straumann, Basel, Switzerland) is installed in an optimal 3D position using a surgical guide. Socket grafting is performed with DBBM (Bio-Oss® 0.25 - 1 mm, Geistlich Pharma AG, Wolhusen, Switzerland) to limit buccal bone resorption and to optimize soft tissue stability (Seyssens et al., 2022).

For patients allocated to C-CTG, a pouch is made in the buccal mucosa extending 3 mm below the buccal bone crest using microsurgical instruments. Thereupon, a free gingival graft with a height of 6 mm and thickness between 1 mm and 2 mm is harvested from the palatal mucosa and de-epithelialized. The length depends on the mesiodistal size of the tooth gap, which varies between 6 mm and 9 mm. Then, the CTG is brought into the pouch and fixed with two single sutures (Seralon 6/0, Serag Wiessner, Naila, Germany) onto the buccal mucosa. Finally, a healing abutment is installed, which is replaced by a provisional implant crown 2 days later. Sutures are removed 1 week after the surgery.

For patients allocated to S-CTG, no pouch is made at the recipient site and a CTG with a height of only 3 mm is harvested from the palate in the way as described above for C-CTG. The small CTG is fixed at the transmucosal aspect (Seralon 6/0, Serag Wiessner, Naila, Germany) onto the buccal mucosa. Again, a healing abutment is installed, which is replaced by a provisional implant crown 2 days later. Sutures are removed 1 week after the surgery.

For patients allocated to DZ, DBBM is applied and condensed up to the level of the buccal soft tissue margin. A healing abutment is installed, which is replaced by a provisional implant crown 2 days later. Usually, sutures are not needed in this group, unless minimal papilla opening was required to extract the tooth. In that case, sutures will be removed after 1 week.

CBCT analysis A CBCT is taken pre-operatively and at one-year follow-up. CBCT images are obtained using a ProMax 3D Max device (Planmeca, Helsinki, Finland) with the same standardized settings (90 kV, 6.3 mA, 9 s, voxel size 200 μm) with a same field of view (50 x 80 mm2) for each patient. Lip retractors are used to clearly visualize the external soft tissue profile, and patients are instructed to fold the tongue backwards for the same reason. Using specialized software (Invivo6, Osteoid Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) CBCT images from the different timepoints are superimposed (figure 1). A reference line is constructed through the long axis of the implant on the 1-year CBCT. A second reference line perpendicular to the long axis is drawn at the level of the implant-abutment interface. Another line is constructed parallel to the second reference line at 1 mm apical to the implant-abutment interface (so-called level -1 mm).

Horizontal buccal bone loss Horizontal buccal bone level is measured as the distance from the long axis of the implant to the buccal bone surface at level -1 mm. Then, the software switches to the superimposed pre-operative CBCT image to do the same measurement while keeping all reference lines. Horizontal buccal bone loss at level -1 mm is calculated by subtracting the pre-operative horizontal buccal bone level from the 1-year horizontal buccal bone level, both at level -1 mm. Hence, negative values represent bone loss. The same methodology is applied to determine horizontal buccal bone loss at level -3 and -5 mm.

Vertical buccal bone loss Vertical buccal bone level is measured as the vertical distance from the buccal bone peak to the reference line at the level of the implant-abutment interface to the nearest 0.1 mm (figure 1). This is registered on the pre-operative CBCT and on the 1-year CBCT. Vertical buccal bone loss is calculated by subtracting the pre-operative vertical bone level from the 1-year vertical bone level. Hence, negative values represent bone loss.

Increase in buccal soft tissue thickness Buccal soft tissue thickness is measured as the distance from the buccal bone surface to the buccal soft tissue profile at level -1 mm to the nearest 0.1 mm. This is registered on the pre-operative CBCT and on the 1-year CBCT. Increase in buccal soft tissue thickness is calculated by subtracting its pre-operative value from the 1-year value. Hence, positive values represent tissue gain.

Succesful regeneration Successful regeneration (primary outcome) is achieved when the combination of socket grafting and transmucosal augmentation (C-CTG or S-CTG or DZ) would be able to counteract any buccal soft tissue loss at level -1 mm. It is assessed on the basis of superimposed CBCTs taken pre-operatively and at one-year follow-up.

Patient-reported outcomes One week after surgery, patients will be asked how many analgesics have been taken.

In addition, they will be asked to rate postoperative pain on a numeric rating scale (0-10).

Clinical outcome Plaque, bleeding on probing and probing depth. At 1-year and 5-year follow-up the treating surgeon evaluates plaque, bleeding on probing and probing depth at four sites around the implant (mesial, buccal, distal, palatal). Each area receives a score of 0 or 1, representing the absence or presence of plaque or bleeding on probing. Probing depth is registered with a manual probe (University North Carolina Probe PCPUNC 156, Hu-Friedy, Frankfurt, Germany) and measurements are rounded up to the nearest 0.5 mm. A mean value is calculated per implant.

Marginal bone loss. Peri-apical radiographs are taken with the long-cone paralleling technique at implant placement, 1-year and 5-year follow-up. Measurements are performed by a blinded examiner in designated software (DBSWIN Imaging Software, Dürr Dental SE, Bietigheim-Bissingen, Germany). Radiographs are calibrated on the basis of implant length. The distance from the implant-abutment interface to the initial bone-to-implant contact - called bone level - is assessed at the mesial and distal aspects of each implant. Marginal bone loss is calculated by subtracting the 1-year bone level and 5-year bone level from the pre-operative bone level. Hence, negative values represent bone loss. Per implant a mean value is calculated.

Soft tissue changes Change in buccal soft tissue profile. An intra-oral scan (Trios, 3shape, Copenhagen, Denmark) is taken prior to surgery and at 1-year and 5-year follow-up. The obtained digital surface models in STL (Surface Tessellation Language) format are imported into the designated software (SMOP, Swissmeda AG, Zurich, Switzerland) to analyze profilometric changes. A study-relevant area of interest (AOI) at the buccal aspect is selected for each site. The AOI extends from the soft tissue margin to 3 mm more apical. In mesio-distal dimension, the AOI reaches from the mesial to the distal line angle. The AOI may vary between sites because of individual anatomic differences but must be kept constant in each site across time points. Digital surface models are superimposed using the best-fit algorithm at unchanged adjacent tooth surfaces. A mean volumetric change (mm3) within the AOI for each site from prior to surgery to 1-year and 5-year follow-up is calculated by the software and divided by the AOI, resulting in the mean change in buccal soft tissue profile. Change in buccal soft tissue profile is assessed by a blinded examiner.

Change in midfacial soft tissue level Change in midfacial soft tissue level from surgery to 1-year and 5-year follow-up is calculated on digital surface models from in the same software (SMOP, Swissmeda AG, Zurich, Switzerland). First, a reference line is drawn connecting the middle of the incisal edge on both adjacent teeth at both timepoints. Then, the distance from this line to the buccal mucosal margin (so-called midfacial soft tissue level) is determined at the centre of each implant to the nearest 0.01 mm.

Change in midfacial soft tissue level Calculated by subtracting midfacial soft tissue level from the preoperative situation from the one at 1-year and 5-year follow-up. Negative values indicate recession; positive values indicate vertical regrowth. Change in midfacial soft tissue level is assessed by a blinded examiner.

Change in mesial and distal papilla level Calculated at the mesial and distal aspect from surgery to 1-year and 5-year follow-up. The methodology is the same as described for the change in midfacial soft tissue level.

Aesthetic outcome Pink Esthetic Score (PES) (Fürhauser et al., 2005) is registered by a trained and blinded examiner using frontal and occlusal clinical pictures taken at 1 year and 5-year follow-up. The PES results in a score from 0 (worst esthetic outcome) to 14 (perfect esthetic outcome).

Statistical analysis SPSS Statistics (SPSS inc., Chicago, IL, USA) is used for data analysis. Inter-rater reliability of hard and soft tissue registrations is assessed on the basis of duplicate measurements of 10 cases and calculation of the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Duplicate measurements are performed by a blinded experienced examiner. For buccal hard and soft tissue changes a linear mixed model with random intercept for patient is fitted including treatment group, time and their two-way interaction as fixed effects. For horizontal buccal bone loss at the different levels, pre-operative buccal bone thickness (assessed to the nearest 0.1 mm on the pre-operative CBCT) and the horizontal dimension of the buccal bone gap (intra-operatively assessed with a periodontal probe to the nearest 0.5 mm immediately following IIP and prior to socket grafting) are included as covariates to increase precision of the estimates. For vertical buccal bone loss, pre-operative vertical buccal bone level is included as covariate and for increase in buccal soft tissue thickness, pre-operative buccal soft tissue thickness is included as covariate. Estimated marginal means with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) are computed per treatment group (FDA, 2023). The number of patients with successful regeneration are compared between the control group and the test groups (C-CTG versus S-CTG and C-CTG versus DZ) using the Fisher's exact test. The number of sites with plaque or bleeding on probing is compared between the control group and the test groups using negative binomial regression.

Medians and interquartile ranges are calculated for probing depth, marginal bone loss, change in buccal soft tissue profile, change in mesial and distal papilla level, and PES. The control group is compared to the test groups using the Mann-Whitney U-test at 1-year and 5-year follow-up. Independent samples Hodges-Lehmann median differences and 95% CIs are calculated.

Peripheral stem cell or bone marrow transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy used to kill tumor cells. Sometimes the transplanted cells can make an immune response against the body's normal tissues. Stem cells that have been treated in the laboratory with filgrastim may prevent this from happening. Combining chemotherapy with bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells. It is not yet known which treatment is more effective for chronic myeloid leukemia.

PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of donor peripheral stem cell transplantation with donor bone marrow transplantation in treating patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.","OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the incidence of persistent cytogenetic or hematologic relapse in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic or accelerated phase treated with transplantation using filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells vs bone marrow from HLA-identical, related donors. II. Compare survival and nonrelapse mortality in patients treated with these regimens. III. Compare incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft versus host disease in patients treated with these regimens. IV. Compare hospitalization and treatment associated expenses for patients treated with these regimens.

OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (15-39 vs 40-65), interval from diagnosis to transplantation (under 2 years vs 2 years or more, and permutations of patient and donor gender. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive a preparative regimen comprising busulfan orally or IV 4 times daily on days -7 to -4 and cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 and -2. Allogeneic filgrastim (G-CSF)-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells are infused on day 0. Arm II: Busulfan and cyclophosphamide are administered as in arm I. Allogeneic bone marrow is infused on day 0. Patients receive graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis comprising methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11 and cyclosporine IV over 1-4 hours or orally every 12 hours on days -1 to 80 and then tapered.

6763607b4c961a86,NCT07262489,Neo-adjuvant Immunotherapy Master Trial for Localized Cancers,Neo-adjuvant Adaptive Master Trial for Localized Cancers With Rapid Evaluation of Molecular & Immune Status for Stratified Immunotherapies in Oncology,NEOREM,UC-IMM-2509,"Most cancer treatments are developed without knowing whether the drug's targets are actually present in a patient's tumor or whether the patient is likely to benefit from the treatment. In addition, the immune environment surrounding the tumor changes significantly during the course of the disease, and the body's immune response to cancer tends to become less effective in later stages.

Currently, standard blood tests provide only basic information about a patient's immune, inflammatory, and metabolic systems. These tests do not offer a comprehensive picture of how each person's immune system is functioning. Similarly, traditional tests on tumor samples-which require frozen or preserved tissue and take a long time to process-are not fast enough to guide treatment decisions during clinical trials.

NEOREM is a ""Master Protocol"" which includes multiple therapeutic sub-protocols testing new immunotherapy strategies. (Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that helps the immune system fight cancer.) Neoadjuvant immunotherapies are treatments given before surgery. Their goals are to shrink the tumor to make it easier to remove, strengthen the immune system's ability to fight cancer, increase the chances of long-term recovery, and reduce the risk of the cancer returning.

This master protocol focuses on cancers that are still localized (have not spread) and aims to personalize treatments based on each patient's individual immuno-biological profile. As a part of this master protocol, a rapid analysis called PORTRAIT-which stands for ""Profile in Onco-Immunology for a Rapid Treatment Research Adapted to Immunity and Tumor""-will be performed using fresh blood and tumor samples from each patient. This profiling uses highly sensitive and specific techniques to accurately detect biological markers that can predict how well someone will respond to immunotherapy before surgery.

NEOREM's overall goal is to test new treatment strategies and new methods of selecting patients (using the PORTRAIT immune profiling) to improve the effectiveness of current standard treatments for certain types of cancer while also reducing their side effects.","Most cancer treatments are developed without knowing whether the drug targets are present in the tumors of patients enrolled in clinical trials or whether the patients have the tumor biology needed to benefit from such treatments. Tumor biology evolves as cancer progresses, resulting in weaker immune responses in advanced stages.

Traditional tumor analyses rely on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) or frozen materials for techniques such as immunohistochemistry (IHC) or DNA/RNA sequencing, which require long turnaround times. Routine blood tests provide only basic information about a patient's immune, inflammatory, and metabolic status, without offering detailed insight into the immune system. Research shows that analyzing fresh tumor and blood samples better predicts immunotherapy responses, supports patient monitoring, and helps identify biological subgroups that may benefit from new treatments.

The PORTRAIT method (Profile in Onco-Immunology for a Rapid Treatment Research Adapted to Immunity and Tumor) reduces turnaround time for biological analyses within NEOREM. It allows patients and oncologists to access relevant tumor and blood information at the molecular and cellular levels, identify appropriate treatment options, and assess treatment effects on the disease. PORTRAIT uses multicolor flow cytometry on fresh mononuclear cells from patient blood and tumor biopsies to screen for specific biomarkers. Plasma and tumor secretome are analyzed for cytokines, chemokines, and soluble factors to provide a comprehensive immune and tumor profile. This approach helps determine which patients are eligible for specific treatments within the sub-protocols.

NEOREM is part of the REMISSION program, which includes a Master Protocol linked to therapeutic sub-protocols. The Master Protocol provides a unified framework to test multiple study drugs efficiently, streamline operations, optimize resources, and accelerate patient access to treatments. Its flexible design allows sub-protocols to be added or closed quickly without affecting ongoing studies, while adaptive analytics integrate evidence across studies to maximize knowledge and leverage historical data. Standardized processes, centralized data infrastructure, and consistent recruitment centers further improve safety, data quality, and operational efficiency.

The goal of the NEOREM protocol is to improve cancer care by accelerating the development of neoadjuvant immunotherapy strategies. These therapies leverage pre-existing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and draining lymph nodes before surgery to strengthen the antitumor immune response. Neoadjuvant therapy may downstage localized tumors, simplify surgery, achieve complete responses, sometimes eliminate the need for major procedures, improve quality of life, and reduce the risk of recurrence.

PORTRAIT immunoprofiling from fresh blood and tumor samples provides a rapid and detailed description of each patient's immune profile. This enables a deeper understanding of disease biology and allows patients to be quickly stratified into the most appropriate therapeutic sub-protocol, supporting truly personalized cancer treatment.",UNICANCER,OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,200.0,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,"NEOREM includes a series of Phase 2 clinical trials that are not randomized. These trials are testing new immunotherapy strategies for localized solid malignancies that are eligible to receive neo-adjuvant therapy and have medical unmet needs related to disease-free survival, overall survival or quality of life. Each patient will undergo PORTRAIT immune profiling before starting neoadjuvant treatment, and again during treatment (at the time of surgery), using fresh blood and tumor tissue samples. This is done to closely study the biological features of the tumor. The progress of the disease and how well the treatment is working will be monitored through medical imaging and evaluated using RECIST v1.1 criteria-a standard method used to measure how tumors respond to treatment. After surgery, a standard adjuvant treatment (an additional therapy to help prevent the cancer from returning) may be recommended by the doctor.

Antibodies are substances in the body that are involved in many biological processes. CNTO 888 is thought to work by blocking a protein called CC-Chemokine Ligand 2 (CCL2). In research studies CCL2 has been shown to increase the growth of new blood vessels which help the tumor to survive. When new blood vessels do not grow, tumors cannot get the food or oxygen they need to grow. Blocking CCL2 may help fight disease.This study consists of two parts, Part A and Part B. In Part A, five different groups of patients will be treated with five different, increasing dose levels of CNTO 888. In Part B, two of the dose levels of CNTO 888 will be tested further in different treatment schedules. CNTO 888 is given by intravenous (into the vein) infusion. Between 1 and 30 patients with advanced cancer will take part in Part A of the study. Between 24 and 33 patients with advanced cancer will take part in Part B of the study.There are three phases in part A of the study. Screening phase, which may last up to 4 weeks. Treatment phase, which may last up to 8 weeks (4 treatments) and can be extended for an extra 9 weeks (4 extra treatments) in case the patient's tumor is not getting bigger. The total treatment period could be up to 17 weeks. Follow up phase will include an end of treatment visit 4 weeks after the last infusion of CNTO 888, visits through week 18 after last infusion as well as long term collection of follow up data. After Part A is completed, up to two doses will be selected for evaluation in part B. In Part B, patients will be placed into one of 3 study groups. There are three phases in Part B of this study. The screening phase, which may last up to 4 weeks. The treatment phase, which may last up to 9 weeks (4 treatments). If the patient's tumor is not getting bigger, the patient's treatment phase may be extended up to 12 weeks (4 treatments). The total treatment period could be up to 21 weeks. The follow up phase will include an end of treatment visit 4 weeks after the last infusion of CNTO 888, visits through week 18 after last infusion as well as long-term collection of follow up data. Safety and effectiveness evaluations will be performed at specified intervals throughout the study and will consist of laboratory tests, vital signs (such as blood pressure), physical examinations and collection of information about the occurrence and severity of adverse events. In Part A of this study, patients will receive either 0.3 , 1.0, 3.0, 10, or 15 mg/kg CNTO 888. The time between the first and second infusion is 4 weeks, with all of the following infusions will be given 2 weeks apart.

1. To evaluate outcome of cases( cosmoses and cognition) after Craniosynostosis surgery
2. \- To ascertain intra- and postoperative complications","Craniosynostosis is defined as the premature fusion of one or more of the sutures normally separating the infant's skull bony plates, resulting in abnormal growth of the cranial vault and skull base, which may influence brain growth and development(1).

Aetiology Primary Craniosynostosis: No cause for the synostosis is recognized in the majority of cases, , but in an increasing proportion (currently about 25%), a mutation is identified. A considerable proportion of these mutations are related to six genes FGFR2, FGFR3, TWIST1, EFNB1, TCF12 and ERF(2).

Types of Craniosynostosis Non-syndromic (or isolated), in which only the skull is affected, The syndromic craniosynostosis is caused by an inherited or genetic condition and associated with craniofacial syndromes(3).

Syndromic craniosynostosis is most commonly found in:

* Apert syndrome
* Crouzon syndrome
* Muenke syndrome
* Pfeiffer syndrome
* Saethre-Chotzen syndrome(4)

Diagnosis:

The skull shape from all directions, and the measurement of the head circumference for calculating the cephalic index (the ratio of maximum breadth to maximum length of the skull). Any sutural ridging, prominent blood vessels on the scalp, and the size, shape and tension of the fontanels should also be assessed.

For evaluating ICP, ophthalmological examination is of great importance. In cases with increased ICP, papilledema is present To confirm the diagnosis The computed tomography (CT) with three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction is considered the most complete and accurate imaging to diagnose craniosynostosis the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an excellent technique for the evaluation of brain(5).

Many types of craniosynostosis require surgery. The surgical procedure is done to relieve pressure on the brain, correct the craniosynostosis, and permit the brain to grow appropriately. Babies with very mild craniosynostosis might not need surgery. Delay surgical intervention causes irreversible loss of vision and permanent cognitive impairment.

a neglected case of craniostenosis, presented with deformity of head with mental retardation, which was operated after delay lead to poor neurological outcome(6).

Surgical management for craniosynostosis is based on the suture(s) involved, the age of the child, and the individual needs for each patient.

* Strip craniectomy
* Sagittal springs also known as cranial spring surgery
* Fronto-orbital advancement /reshaping
* Cranial vault remodeling and reconstruction.
* Posterior vault distraction osteogenesis (7) Outcome variables debated include magnitude and durability of head shape improvement, cost, neurodevelopmental trajectory, burden of care to patient, and intra- and postoperative complication rates(8).

Most frequent complication was non-filiated postoperative hyperthermia followed by infection , subcutaneous haematoma), dural tears and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage.

This study is the first detailed pharmacokinetic evaluation (study of a drug in the body to watch how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized and eliminated over a period of time) of SCIO-469 in a new capsule formulation. Methotrexate is frequently prescribed as treatment for patients with rheumatoid arthritis; thus, SCIO-469 could potentially be used along with methotrexate.

The study will also learn about the safety of using a higher dose.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

Does a higher radiation dose lead to fewer treatment failures (meaning the tumor growing back or causing serious side effects) one year after treatment? What are the side effects associated with the high dose compared to the standard dose? How does each radiation dose affect a patient's pain and quality of life?

Researchers will randomly assign participants (like a coin toss) to one of two groups to compare the outcomes:

The Standard Dose Group: Will receive a single radiation treatment of 16 Gy. The High Dose Group: Will receive a single, more powerful radiation treatment of 20 Gy.

Participants in this study will:

Receive a single, one-time, highly-focused radiation treatment (SSRS) to the spinal tumor.

Attend regular follow-up visits at the clinic for checkups and imaging scans (like MRI).

Complete questionnaires about their pain levels and quality of life during these visits.","Study Rationale and Background:

Metastatic cancer to the spine is a significant clinical challenge that can lead to severe pain, neurological compromise, and a diminished quality of life. Stereotactic Spine Radiosurgery (SSRS), also known as Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR), has emerged as a paradigm-shifting treatment. This advanced, non-invasive technique allows for the delivery of a single, highly ablative dose of radiation with unprecedented precision, which has shown excellent rates of pain control and tumor response while minimizing dose to the adjacent, critical spinal cord.

Despite the widespread adoption and promising results of SSRS, the optimal dose-fractionation schedule remains an area of active investigation. Previous research, including the landmark RTOG 0631 trial, has established single-fraction 16 Gy as an effective regimen. However, other evidence suggests that a higher radiation dose may lead to more durable local tumor control. This prospective, randomized phase II study, known as the SHINE trial, is designed to formally compare the efficacy and safety of a higher single-fraction dose against the current standard dose.

Study Design and Procedures:

This is a two-arm, parallel-group, randomized, open-label, multi-center study. After providing informed consent and confirming eligibility, participants will be randomly assigned on a 1:1 basis to receive either the standard dose or the high dose of SSRS. The randomization process will incorporate a minimization procedure to ensure balance between the two arms for the key prognostic factor of epidural or paraspinal tumor extension.

The core intervention for all participants is a single session of SSRS. The treatment will be meticulously planned using fused CT and MRI scans to accurately delineate the tumor (Gross Tumor Volume, GTV) and the area at potential microscopic risk (Clinical Target Volume, CTV), following international consensus guidelines from the International Spine Radiosurgery Consortium (ISRC). Radiation will be delivered using state-of-the-art techniques (IMRT or VMAT/RapidArc) with rigorous on-board image guidance to ensure accuracy. Strict dose constraints will be applied to protect the spinal cord and other nearby organs at risk.

Follow-up and Data Collection:

Following treatment, all participants will enter a comprehensive follow-up phase lasting up to two years. The schedule includes regular clinical evaluations, neurological assessments, and serial imaging (MRI and/or CT) to monitor treatment response and detect any potential late toxicities. Additionally, participants will complete validated questionnaires to assess changes in pain and health-related quality of life. Blood samples will be collected at baseline for correlative science studies to investigate potential genetic biomarkers (such as DDR2) and circulating factors that may predict treatment response or risk of skeletal side effects.

The purpose of this study is therefore to define the concentration and biological activity of IGF-I, IGF-II, BDNF, NGF and sCD-163 in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum in patients with Alzheimer's compared with controls.","Introduction Dementia The estimated prevalence of dementia in Denmark is 85.000 (2011) and the global prevalence is close to 36 million (2010). Furthermore the number is predicted to double in the next 20 years, primarily due to the demographic ageing. The costs of dementia accounts for 1% of the world's GDP - a perspective that will challenge the current healthcare systems and national economies (1,2,3).

Dementia includes a number of progressive degenerative brain diseases. Dementia is characterized by progressive deterioration in cognition, function and behavior that is sufficiently severe to compromise social and occupational functioning. Dementia is characterized by loss of episodic memory, difficulty in naming and word finding, apraxia, executive dysfunction and changes in personality and mood. The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease (4, 5, 6).

The pathogenesis of Alzheimer dementia remains elusive. For many years the pathophysiological hallmark of Alzheimers dementia has been the toxicity caused by the accumulation of the proteins amyloid-beta in plaques and phosphorylated tau associated with neurofibrillary tangles. However, this theory is based on the genetic ""early-onset familial Alzheimers"", which is a less frequent inherited type. Currently, the hypotheses on the pathogenesis of Alzheimer actually disagree with that of the amyloid-beta theory. Thus, there is a need to increase our understanding of the mechanisms leading to the most common forms of Alzheimer's disease. A better understanding of the disease may enable an earlier diagnosis and importantly, a causal treatment of Alzheimer as opposed to the merely symptomatic options available to day (4, 7, 8, 9).

IGF-system One of the main areas of recent research in dementia is the role of neurotrophic support, a research area which embraces insulin and the insulin-like growth factor system. Insulin and the IGF system are important in normal somatic growth, development, tissue repair and regeneration throughout life. Earlier studies have indicated that impairments in cerebral glucose utilization and energy metabolism represent very early abnormalities that precede or accompany the initial stages of cognitive impairment. However, type 2 diabetes, which is often characterized by insulin resistance, has not been established as a cause of Alzheimer although there is a correlation between insulin resistance and cognitive dysfunction.

The cellular signaling pathways of IGF-I and IGF-II overlap to a great extent with the pathways used by insulin, and all three proteins bind to the same receptors though with different affinities. Several studies have shown that the ratio between the concentrations of IGF-I in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma (the CSF/plasma ratio) is reduced in Alzheimer patients. Interestingly, IGF-I seems to promote amyloid-beta clearance.

IGF-II has been less studied but it is expressed in the brain both during development and in adulthood and declines with ageing. In the brain the relative concentration is highest in the hippocampus. (10-14). Furthermore, our group has novel data indicating that in CSF, IGF-II is the most important growth factor when it comes to activating the IGF-I receptor (Mia-Maiken Kallestrup et al., manuscript in preparation).

Memory Memory is a question of consolidation whereby newly learned labile information becomes stronger and resilient to disruption. This process depends on de novo RNA and protein synthesis and the function of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and the CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP), both of which are transcription factors. Former studies have shown that there is a binding site for C/EBP in the promoter region of the IGF-II gene in liver and other tissues (10).

IGF-II and memory To solve the puzzle of dementia it is important to explain early changes in biomarkers in early stages of dementia and thereby possibly reveal the pathogenesis and possible treatments. An experiment with rats and memory might already have taken the first step towards this. It has been demonstrated that administration of IGF-II to rats significantly enhances memory retention and prevents forgetting. Furthermore inhibitory avoidance learning (a paradigm in which the subject learns to associate a particular context with the occurrence) leads to an increase in the hippocampal expression of IGF-II. Finally, yet importantly, injections of recombinant IGF-II into hippocampus after training or memory retrieval significantly enhance memory retention and prevent forgetting (10).

Neurotrophic growth factors:

The human adult brain is able to generate new neurons even though it has a limited capacity. Possibly this capacity depends on sufficient neurotrophic growth factors. The neurotrophic factors include nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).

BDNF is important in neuronal survival, synaptic plasticity and memory, which along with the tendency of increased levels of BDNF in early stages of Alzheimer's indicate a connection. The increase of BDNF in early stages of Alzheimer's could be a reflection of compensation for the neurodegeneration. During the progression of Alzheimer's the level of BDNF is decreasing to a level of healthy elderly people.

NGF induces growth of neurons and maintains neuron proliferation interacting with other growth factors. Levels of NGF in serum, CSF or brain do not seem to differ from Alzheimer's patients to normal elderly patients but seem to vary between different brain regions. Finally the expression pattern of BDNF and NGF highly correlates with amyloid concentration (15).

Cluster of differentiation 163(CD-163) CD-163 is a scavenger receptor, which recognizes and uptakes macromolecules for the hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex and its levels in an indication of monocyte-macrophage activation. The soluble form of the receptor is called sCD163 and is found in plasma. Plasma sCD163 levels are up-regulated in a large range of inflammatory diseases (16).

Hypothesis Patients with dementia have a deregulated concentration and/or activity of IGF-I, IGF-II, NGF, BDNF and sCD-163 in cerebrospinal fluid.

Purpose To define the concentration and biological activity of IGF-I, IGF-II, BDNF, NGF and sCD-163 in the cerebrospinal fluid and serum in patients with Alzheimer's compared with controls (patients with unspecified neurological symptoms or disease).

Method Study population All participating patients must be over the age of 18 years old. They are excluded from the study in case of acute bacterial neuro infection and acute bleeding The study population of this project will include all patients with established or suspected dementia, who will undergo a lumbar puncture at the Department of Neurology at Aarhus University Hospital as part of their diagnostic work-up.

Controls include patients with unspecified neurological symptoms or diseases who will undergo a lumbar puncture at the Department of Neurology at Aarhus University Hospital as part of their diagnostic work-up irrespective of this study.

The patients will receive information about the research project and will be asked to give their content to participation. The participation implies extraction of 2-3 ml extra of spinal fluid and an extra blood sample(10ml), which will be used for analysis of IGF system components and neurotrophic factors. Participants will not receive any form of payment, but can receive compensation for transportation.

At all times during the diagnostic work-up and consequently in the research project we will take the patients mental and physical condition into consideration. The research project will be carried out according to the Act on Processing of Personal Data.

At the Department of Neurology at Aarhus University Hospital, the Dementia Clinic use lumbar puncture as a diagnostic tool in approximately three patients per week. It is estimated that about 1/3 to 1/2 of these patients will end up with the diagnosis Alzheimer and these patients will ultimately be included in the project during a period of 36-40 weeks. Overall during the study period this will enable inclusion of 50-60 patients.

Analysis The spinal fluid and the serum will be analysed at the Medical Research Laboratory. The spinal fluid and blood samples will be deposited in a research biobank at Aarhus University Hospital. The plan is to carry out all the biochemical analyses at the same time when all samples are collected. In case of knew knowledge in the field we intend to deposit the samples for 5 years after this project. If the samples are to be used for another project The National Committee on Health Research Ethics and the Danish Data Protection Agency will demand an application once more.

The immunological concentrations of IGF-I and IGF-II are measured by validated in-house analyses. Furthermore, Aarhus University Hospital has a unique technique, whereby it is possible to measure the bioactivity of IGF-I and -II in the cerebrospinal fluid. The technique is based on a cell-based in-house bioassay developed in 2003. This method takes in to account that a large part of the IGF-I and IGF-II is bound to proteins and thereby to be considered biological inactive. The bioassay is able to measure the ability of both serum and cerebrospinal fluid to stimulate IGF-IR in vitro which makes the method much more specific. Pilot investigations from our group have shown that it is possible to measure the biological IGF-IR activity in cerebrospinal fluid. It has been proven that:

i) The biological IGF in vitro activity of cerebrospinal fluid primarily comes from IGF-II ii) The biological activity is far higher than expected as compared to simple measures of concentration owing to the low concentrations of IGF-binding proteins.

The immunological concentrations of the IGF-binding proteins will be measured by commercial or in-house developed immunoassays and ligand blotting techniques.

The concentrations of NGF, BDNF and sCD-163 in spinal fluid and serum will be analysed by already established techniques and the spinal fluid will be examined with spectrometry.

Clinical examination The clinical examination will be performed as a natural part of the examination of dementia. This includes medical history and an objective examination, CT scan and cognitive tests including MMSE (mini-mental state examination) and ACE (Adenbrooke´s Cognitive Examination). In the case of doubt a more extended examination will be performed by a neurophysiologist. Information from the clinical examination in form of medical record will be used to evaluate the possibility of dementia as diagnosis including the progression of the disease and thereby to evaluate the possible deregulated concentrations and/or activities of IGF-I, IGF-II, NGF, BDNF and sCD-163 in cerebrospinal fluid.

Power The bioactivity of IGF in cerebrospinal fluid in patients with dementia have not earlier been determined. Pilot data indicate that bioactivity from IGF-II in healthy people(n= 9) is 57 ± 13 ng/ml(mean ± SD). If the difference in a patient group is set to 26ng/ml ( ̴ 2 x SD) then inclusion of 10 persons per group give the project a power of 90% by use of ANOVA and a significant level of 5 %. It has therefore been chosen to include 15 patients in the project.

Statistic The program ANOVA will be used for statistical analyses. Parametric or non-parametric tests will be used depending of the normal distribution of data. In all statistical analysis a 5% level of significance will be used.

Perspective As earlier mentioned the costs of dementia already account for 1% of the world's GDP and the prevalence of dementia is expected to double within the next twenty years. The progressive nature of the disease means that estimated 43% of cases with dementia need a high level of care (equivalent to a nursing home). Therefore, it is obvious that prevention, delayed onset, slowed progression and potential curability are crucial factors for not only the well-being of patients and relatives but also for the economy of the health care systems. (2,17) This research project is based on the recent theory of dementia as a disease in the IGF-system, but as opposed to other studies we are able to measure concentrations as well as bioactivity. This will potentially open up for further knowledge about the dynamic of dementia and thereby potentially reveal further understanding of the pathogenesis and medical targets of dementia.

Ethical consideration Ethical considerations in general The tests performed on the patients involved in this research project are lumbar puncture and blood samples. Both of these tests will be performed as part of the diagnostic workup irrespective of this study.

It involves some risks to perform a lumbar puncture, which include post lumbar puncture headache with a incidence of 12 %, but is most common in younger patients. Most frequently, the headache has a short duration and it may be cured with application of a blood-patch. The use of a needle to the lumbar puncture can cause temporary lumbar pain and an accumulation Ethical considerations for patients with dementia The concerned patient group causes an extended ethical consideration. As mentioned earlier the symptoms of dementia causes memory loss, difficulty in finding the right words and understanding what people are saying. As such it is questionable whether the patients are able to make an independent decision on whether to participate in the project (6).

All of the dementia patients will have all the tests performed as part of the standard diagnostic work up for dementia. Therefore this study does not introduce any additional investigation defending the ethical aspect of this study. In consideration of the low risk involved in this project, the mild dementia forms and the high prevalence and seriousness of the disease we evaluate this project to be ethically acceptable. Furthermore it is of great importance to examine the pathogenesis and possible targets of dementia.

Aim Positive, negative as well as inconclusive results from this study will be published.

cf030ca828abc1eb,NCT02713750,RH and Adolescents,Optimization of Reproductive Health Care for Female Adolescents Living With HIV (Reproductive Health in HIV-infected Female Adolescents),,HIV-NAT 176,This study will create a model of reproductive health services for HIV-positive female adolescents in Asia.,"For the implementation of risk reduction interventions, it is equally important to provide specific knowledge and continuous counseling on different preventive options. A perfect preventive method, which provides highly reliable dual protection both from unintended pregnancies and from HIV/STDs with no side effects and which is completely accepted, is not available. Many authors consider that the most effective way to achieve dual protection is the simultaneous use of two contraceptive methods, one of which is a barrier method such as the male or female condom, and the other a highly effective contraceptive method, such as hormonal contraception (HC), intrauterine device (IUD) or sterilization. This is called dual contraception. Therefore this project will focus on specific reproductive service delivery for these groups of patients. As the age group is very young, the investigators will use in the study only reversible highly effective methods of contraception - HC, combined or progestin only, and an IUD - and condoms. For example, HC for HIV-positive women has been studied extensively in the last two decades, yet there are still no definitive answers regarding key issues - HIV disease progression, genital tract HIV shedding and infectivity, pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions between hormones and ARVs, and therefore a possibility for compromise of contraceptive effect and/or ARV failure, and last but not least, metabolic outcomes. Data on the effect of hormonal contraception on HIV disease progression is still inconclusive. Unfortunately there is only a limited number of studies in this field, with very small sample sizes and in most cases outside ""real life"" conditions.

Apalutamide and abiraterone acetate may stop the growth of cancer cells either by killing the cells or by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Hormone therapy, using gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog, may fight prostate cancer by lowering the amount of testosterone the body makes. Giving apalutamide, gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog, and abiraterone acetate may work better in treating participants with prostate cancer.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the rate of pathologic stage =\< pT2N0 at prostatectomy for Group A (gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog \[luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist (LHRHa)\] plus apalutamide 240 mg orally \[PO\] daily for 6 months as preoperative therapy) and Group B (LHRHa plus apalutamide 240 mg PO daily plus abiraterone acetate 1000 mg PO daily and prednisone 5 mg PO once daily \[QD\] for 6 months as preoperative therapy).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To assess the tumor epithelium volume following treatment in groups A and B. II. To assess the rate of positive surgical margins in Group A and Group B. III. To assess the time to prostate specific antigen (PSA) recurrence (TTRPSA). IV. To assess the safety profile of the two treatment arms (apalutamide with and without abiraterone acetate and low dose prednisone) for six months in a preoperative setting.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. Assessment of the steroid hormone metabolome in blood plasma and tissue by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.

II. Assessment of androgen signaling (canonical and non-canonical) and candidate pathways of resistance to androgen signaling inhibition by protein and ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis.

III. Assessment of citrate intracellular tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) metabolite concentrations with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LCMS/MS).

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) data on chronic diseases; Every year, 41 million people in the world die due to chronic diseases, and it is stated that these numbers correspond to 74% of the deaths in the world. Nowadays, chronic diseases are becoming an increasing health problem, especially for children and adolescents. According to WHO, the incidence of chronic diseases in adolescence is reported to be 15%. According to the report published by the American Academy of Pediatrics (APA), 10-20 million children and adolescents in the United States (USA) have some kind of chronic disease.Diabetes is one of the most common non-communicable chronic diseases globally. Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disease that develops as a result of insufficiency, deficiency and/or absence of the insulin hormone secreted from beta cells in the pancreas, is characterized by hyperglycemia, and causes disorders in carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. It has a chronic course and is the most common metabolic disease in childhood. Although there are different types of diabetes, Type 1 diabetes is common in childhood. Type 1 diabetes cases constitute 10-15% of all diabetic patients, and this rate is increasing. Genetic, environmental and autoimmune factors play an important role in the development of Type 1 diabetes . The incidence of the disease, which is often seen between the ages of 7-15, increases between the ages of 4-6 and 10-14. According to the 10th Diabetes Atlas data published by the International Diabetes Federation in 2021; There are 536.6 million people with diabetes worldwide, and this number is expected to increase to 783.2 million in 2045. It is reported that the number of individuals with diabetes among children and adolescents between the ages of 0-19 worldwide is approximately 1.99 million, and 1.2 million of this number consists of children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes. In our country, it is reported that the number of children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes between the ages of 0-18 is approximately 17 thousand and the number of adolescents with diabetes between the ages of 10-18 is approximately 13 thousand.The fact that diabetes is a disease that is not easy to manage, combined with problems such as estrangement from parents in adolescence, increased sense of independence, physiological change and peer pressure, can cause many difficulties for the adolescent in fulfilling his developmental tasks.

In studies conducted with adolescents with type 1 diabetes; In the study to determine the quality of life of healthy children/adolescents with Type 1 diabetes aged 4-15, it was found that the quality of life of children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes was lower than that of healthy children and adolescents.

In order to determine the time management skills of adolescents with Type 1 diabetes and the effect of these skills on metabolic control, another study with 69 adolescents with Type 1 diabetes between the ages of 13-19, using the Diabetes Adolescent Diagnosis Form, Diabetes Time Management Questionnaire (DBYA), Habits and Behaviors in Adaptation to Diabetes. In the research conducted using the and Information Survey (DUADBA), Metabolic Control and Daily Record Form; It has been stated that adolescents with good time management manage diabetes better and that managing diabetes well does not affect metabolic control.study applied the Psychological Symptom Screening Test (SCL-90-R) to 56 individuals with Type 1 diabetes between the ages of 7 and 21 in order to determine the psychological symptoms and findings of children and adolescents attending a diabetes camp. As a result of this research, ""50.9% of the patients had somatization, 47.3% had anxiety, 43.9% had obsession, 33.3% had depression, 37.5% had psychosis, 48.2% had It was determined that there were multiple psychiatric findings, including anger in 100% of patients and phobia in 28.1%.In the study to examine the self-concept of children/adolescents with Type 1 diabetes and their ways of coping with stress; It has been stated that self-concept is higher in those with a short duration of diabetes or 11-15 years than in those with a diabetes duration of 6-10 years, and that coping with stress was found to be higher in adolescents aged 14-17 without Type 1 diabetes than in adolescents with diabetes .

In the research conducted with 349 adolescents with Type 1 diabetes and 409 healthy individuals between the ages of 6-18 from Kuwait, in order to examine the social and psychological conditions of children/adolescents; Depression and anxiety levels of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes were found to be higher and their psychosocial relationships were worse.In a study to examine the symptoms of depression in adolescents with Type 1 diabetes, including 45 male and 72 female adolescents with Type 1 diabetes, depressive symptoms were found in 50% of the adolescents. It has also been reported that adolescents between the ages of 14 and 16 have more depressive symptoms than younger ones.

In the study which the coping skills with anxiety and glycemic control were investigated in adolescents with Type 1 diabetes, 145 individuals were studied and the Coping Inventory of Stressful Situations was applied. In this study, it was found that as the duration of the disease increases, anxiety decreases and the ability to cope with the disease increase.In the study on the prevalence of depression and anxiety in individuals with Type 1 diabetes, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used. In a study conducted with a total of 502 individuals, it was found that anxiety was more common than depression in individuals with Type 1 diabetes, and depression and anxiety were more common in women than in men .

In the study investigating depressive symptoms in children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes, the Children's Depression Inventory was administered to 145 children and adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes. As a result of the research, high rates of depression were found in 15% of children and adolescents. It has also been reported that depression increases in girls and with increasing age .

In the meta-analysis study , it was stated that only 51% of patients with Type 2 diabetes reached the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) target of \<7%. Studies on HbA1c in adolescents with type 1 diabetes are limited in number; In the HbA1c study conducted by with 66 071 children and adolescents in 8 high-income countries, it was stated that the HbA1c value varied between 7.6% and 8.8% and that HbA1c increased significantly during the transition from childhood to adolescence Type 1 diabetes; In addition to being a metabolic, chronic and organic disease, it is also a disease that has a psychosocial dimension. Studies have shown that the rate of psychiatric disorders in adults with diabetes varies between 33% and 42% and is 2-3 times higher than the general prevalence rate in society, and another study has shown that in children aged 8-17, children and adolescents with insulin-dependent Type 1 diabetes, It is stated that they have more mental difficulties than their healthy peers.Adolescents with type 1 diabetes experience physical, emotional and social problems. It is suggested that the reason for this is that both the blood sugar level and its irregularities directly affect the brain and psychological functions, and the blood sugar level is affected by psychological and emotional changes. A child/adolescent with type 1 diabetes is obliged to carry out interventions such as measuring blood sugar more than once a day, adjusting the insulin dose and administering insulin for the management of the disease, and must cope with this situation. Due to all these reasons, in adolescents with Type 1 diabetes; Depression, anxiety disorder, decrease in quality of life, eating disorder, fear of hypoglycemia, difficulty in coping and adjustment disorder may develop.

8c3429b12c1bd7d0,NCT01685450,NIMIP: Non Invasive Measurement of the Intracranial Pressure,Validation of a New Non Invasive Method of Indirect Measurement of the Intracranial Pressure Variations,MINIPIC,CHU 0123,"The intracranial pressure (ICP), defined by the hydrostatic pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), is a key parameter for diagnosing and treating several neurosurgical diseases. Continuous ICP monitoring has an important place in neuro-intensive care for patients with severe head trauma and severe meningeal hemorrhage.

Until now the assessment of ICP requires invasive methods, with a pressure transducer either within the ventricular CSF or within the brain parenchyma. The pressure sensor placement is performed in a neurosurgery department. These invasive methods have also disadvantages: highest risk of infections, catheter misplaced, and risk of bleeding. All these justify the development of a non invasive method. The Biophysics Laboratory (School of Medicine of Clermont-Ferrand) described that the intra-labyrinthic pressure (ILP) modify the functional activities of the outer hair cells in the cochlea.

Cochlear activities' recording is non-invasive and technically simple. A probe is gently inserted into the outer portion of the external ear canal.

Anatomical studies showed communication between the subarachnoid spaces and the perilymphatic compartment by the cochlear aqueduct. Thereby, increases in ICP are transferred to increases in intra-cochlear pressure, which is detected as modifications in cochlear activities.

CSF dynamic tests, as constant flow infusion test, are conducted in patients in the diagnosis of the idiopathic adult hydrocephalus syndrome. Artificial CSF is infused through a lumbar needle, into the CSF space at a constant rate, and the corresponding rise in ICP is registered and analyzed.

The objective of this study is to assess prospectively the accuracy and the precision of a new method for non invasive ICP measurement (using cochlear activities) compared with invasive gold standard CSF pressure measurement during CSF dynamic tests.","The purpose of this study is to examine the evolution of the electrophysiological cochlear activity (cochlear microphonic potential, CMP), with a non invasive method, during invasive ICP monitoring. The data analysis will determine relationship between ICP variations and CMP variations.

Patients, from the neurosurgery department, investigated for 'normal pressure' chronic hydrocephalus are involved in CSF dynamic test. This complex protocol, including infusion test and invasive CSF monitoring, is needed in order to confirm the diagnosis. CSF dynamic tests, a socalled 'perfusion test', are performed in an operating theater, the patient had to be awake but sedated. During perfusion test, electrophysiological cochlear activities are measured with a gold tiptrode (Etymotic Research, Elk Grove Village, Ill) gently inserted into the ear canal.

Electrophysiological cochlear activities, so called electrocochleography (ECochG), are a non invasive and totally passive method used in routine in ENT department. The response measured in ECochG is the cochlear microphonic potential (CMP), generated by the outer hair cells following by presenting tone burst at 1kHz. CMP is recorded with the help of an Echodia® hand-held equipment.

Previously animal studies have shown that the phase of CM is sensitive to ICP changes and CM phase shifts exhibit the same time course as those of otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs).

The phase changes of CM can indeed be used as a non-invasive tool for monitoring intralabyrinthine and intracranial pressures.","University Hospital, Clermont-Ferrand",OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,25.0,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,,,,,SINGLE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Within-subjects (repeated-measures) design will be utilized to compare follow-up outcomes to baseline.

The following assessments will be performed at baseline, then at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months following surgery:

* Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)
* Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition (ADAS-Cog)
* General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition (GPCOG)
* Eight-item Informant Interview to Differentiate Aging and Dementia (AD8) Subjects who have early stage AD confirmed by a neuropsychological test (MoCA) and who are healthy enough to undergo surgery.

The experimental procedure to be performed is omental transposition (OT) surgery. It will be performed as a laparoscopic or open procedure for omental lengthening and an open procedure for brain access, with a general surgeon performing the omental lengthening/tunneling and a neurosurgeon performing brain access/brain biopsy/omental placement on brain.

Up to twenty-five (25) subjects, with the first 5 subjects being part of a learning curve group and the next 20 subjects being part of the experimental group.

The duration of each subject's participation will be approximately 25 months from screening through the 24 month follow-up visit.","The experimental procedure to be performed is omental transposition surgery, during which a general surgeon and a neurosurgeon work as a team to transpose a pedicle omental graft to the surface of the brain. The general surgeon is responsible for performing a laparotomy/laparoscopy, elongating the omentum into a long pedicle and developing an extensive subcutaneous tunnel up the chest and neck to the head. The neurosurgeon is responsible for performing the craniotomy and securing the omentum on the brain.

Creating an intact omental pedicled flap requires the services of a general surgeon and neurosurgeon. The first step in the operation is to obtain access to the abdominal cavity laparoscopically using four 5cm trocars, or via laparotomy through an upper midline incision. The omentum is then removed from the transverse colon, after which it is separated from its proximal and central attachments to the stomach. The omentum detachments are made directly on the greater curvature of the stomach, leaving the gastroepiploic arteries and veins within the still-connected omentum apron.

Final separation of the omentum from the proximal portion of the stomach is done by dividing the left gastroepiploic vessels, which at the highest proximal level on the stomach become the short gastric vessels. The vascular connections to and from the omentum are now maintained solely from the right gastric and right gastroepiploic vessels. In order for the omental pedicle graft to reach the brain without tension, further surgical tailoring of the omentum is carried out, with care being taken to ensure the preservation of a major omental artery and vein.

After the omentum has been lengthened to an appropriate extent to reach the head, several small (3- to 4-inch) transverse incisions are made on the chest wall slightly lateral to the midline, with the side of the midline to make the transverse incisions depending on which cerebral hemisphere the omentum is to be placed. These transverse incisions are connected subcutaneously, thus creating a tunnel that begins at the upper pole of the midline abdominal incision and travels subcutaneously, up the chest wall and neck to behind the ear.

Although the subcutaneous tissue behind the ear is extremely dense, it is essential that the tunnel at this location be at least 2-3 finger lengths in width so that there is no constriction on the omentum in this particular area within the tunnel. As the omentum in the tunnel passes behind the ear, it goes beneath the base of the scalp flap that had been previously dissected in making the initial craniotomy incision.

The neurosurgery portion of the operation involves removal of a single piece of bone over the temporal-frontal area, opening the dura mater, followed by the removal of patches of arachnoid membrane, with care being taken to avoid blood vessels on the surface of the brain.

At this point in the operation, the omentum is laid directly upon the parietal-temporal-frontal area, after which the dura mater is sutured to the omentum. It is not necessary that the edges of the omentum be applied to the cut edges of the dura since the omentum can be tucked under the edges of the dura for greater coverage of the brain. The edges of the dura are then sewn to the top surface of the omentum using absorbable sutures and the craniotomy is closed.","Bariatric Medicine Institute, Salt Lake City, UT",OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,25.0,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,,TREATMENT,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

It entails a greater risk of morbidity (thromboembolic accident and cardiac insufficiency) and of cardiovascular mortality (mortality increased by a factor 1,7 - 2) independents of the causal pathology or the associated risk factors. For all these reasons, it raises a real problem of public health.

The medical treatment of PAROXYSTIC or persistent atrial fibrillation associates antiarrythmic and anticoagulant. The purpose of it is to maintain the sinusal rhythm and to prevent the thromboembolic complications. The success rate of the treatment antiarrythmic is disappointing, not exceeding, on average, 50 % with 1 year. In addition the incidence of the side effects of these molecules as that of the anticoagulants is far from being negligible.

Other not-pharmacological therapeutic alternatives were proposed among resistant patients, such final cardiac stimulation whose results are not currently very convincing. Ablation by catheter is, except the surgery whose indications are exceptional, the only curative treatment of AF. The complications of the procedure are rare (1 to 2%), but they can be severe. The indication of ablation for which there is currently a consensus is that of AF PAROXYSTIC repeating or persistent, symptomatic, on c?ur normal or pathological, resistant to at least 1 major treatment antiarrythmic. The effectiveness of ablation was validated by many studies within the framework of PAROXYSTIC or persistent AF in very specialized centers. The diffusion of this mode of treatment is limited in our country where very few centers practise it because of a long and difficult training of the technique, claiming a great expertise, but also of the need for human and material means important. The number of ablations carried out in the consensual indications in 2003 in France was approximately 450. This figure is very weak compared to the prevalence of this disorder of the rate/rhythm. This leads in the few centers invested to long withdrawal periods for the patient whom can reach 4 to 12 months.

Awaited benefit of ablation by catheter:

1. reduction of the costs of health thanks to the suppression of any treatment and with a reduction of the duration and frequency of the hospitalizations and consultations
2. faster rehabilitation of the patients in the active life.

Principal objectives of this evaluation: medical and economic:

1. medical evaluation of the effectiveness of ablation by radio frequency of AF under conditions of real practice: persistence of the sinusal rhythm. Ablation should make it possible to cure 70 % of the treated patients
2. costing of the technique and utilization of the results expressed in avoided costs, reduction of the stops of work and quality of life, compared with those of the medical treatment studied retrospectively on 1 year.

Secondary objectives:

1. evaluation of the risk of ablation: complications related to the procedure and inherent with the treated arrhythmia,
2. evaluation of the quality of life of the treated patients: use of antiarrythmic, the anticoagulants, questionnaires of quality of life: SF 36, professional renewal of activity
3. analysis of the impact of the setting in?uvre of the technique of ablation on the system of care of the various hospital complexes concerned
4. exploratory study of determination of the criteria of success/failure of ablation.

Method:

national, prospective, comprising 1 year of inclusion and 2ans of follow-up but also retrospective multicentric evaluation over the year preceding ablation, each patient constituting his own witness. Considering an assumption of success awaited of ablation of about 70 %, the number of patients included on 1 year will have to be 225 in order to obtain a precision about ± 6 % in the determination of the success rate of the method under conditions of real practice. In addition this size of sample will allow an analysis of the various medico-economic criteria and the construction of a multivariate model of prediction of the success of ablation according to the characteristics of the patients. It was checked that this size of sample was perfectly possible taking into account current flows of patients.

Criteria of inclusion:

They will undergo an embolization procedure in interventional radiology where the goal is to provide treatment directly into the liver tumor. These treatments are delivered into the blood vessels feeding the tumors. Improving these treatments relies on better understanding the blood flow into the tumor. By understanding how much blood flows into the tumors, the goal is to make sure there is the best chance of killing the tumor. The investigators are attempting to use a special type of CT scan during the procedure to determine the blood flow to the tumors.","Accurate liver imaging is critically important for the appropriate management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. The unique capability of the 4 dimensional (4D) CT system that combines CT and vascular imaging in real time has the great potential to provide physiologic and functional information to the operators to help guide therapy decisions during interventional procedures. However, the workflow, protocols and parameters have not been studied and optimized to support the use of perfusion techniques during interventional procedures. Efforts to reduce contrast and radiation doses associated with perfusion imaging to as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) are also important steps to ensure patient safety while generating clinically meaningful images. Reducing radiation doses may be achieved by adjusting scan parameters, then applying reconstruction techniques to improve the image quality. The new generation of reconstruction algorithms, such as Model-Based iterative reconstruction, or deep-learning reconstruction algorithms (e.g. AiCE), simultaneously improve noise (lower dose) and enhances low contrast characteristics (less contrast). This pilot study aims to demonstrate the use of 4D CT system to acquire liver perfusion information to support the interventional procedure, and to derive as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) dose levels and examine the robustness of reconstruction algorithms that generate clinically meaningful perfusion maps.

The study will investigate the impact of different dose levels, and the robustness of reconstruction algorithms on CT perfusion maps. A successful study could allow for dissemination of these methods for use to the wider physician audience with an optimum ALARA dose levels. Furthermore, the potential knowledge gained from this study will further educate the medical community about the potential benefits of 4D CT intra-arterial CT perfusion as an adjunct imaging technique and may steer the direction for future larger scale trials and studies.",Palo Alto Veterans Institute for Research,OTHER,SPONSOR,OBSERVATIONAL,False,ESTIMATED,20.0,,,,,COHORT,PROSPECTIVE,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

eec000b507c70b7a,NCT03216291,Home Versus Office Biofeedback Therapy for Fecal Incontinence,Home Versus Office Biofeedback Therapy for Fecal Incontinence,,HomeVOfficeFI,"Biofeedback therapy is a labor-intensive, multi-disciplinary, team approach for the management of patients with Fecal Incontinence. It is not easily available to the vast majority of patients in the community with this problem. It is therefore imperative that a more pragmatic therapeutic approach that can be administered easily in the community ought to be developed. However, whether a treatment program that is based on home-training can be just as useful as office-based training has not been evaluated. The purpose of this study is to assess whether having patients train their pelvic floor muscles at home is as effective as in-office biofeedback training.","The specific hypotheses that will be tested are:

1\. Home training produces a similar degree of improvement as office biofeedback in

1. overall number of episodes of fecal incontinence
2. normalization of anorectal manometric pressures
3. Overall quality of life and symptom perception on previously validated Fecal Incontinence questionnaires

Thirty patients with fecal incontinence will be recruited for this eight week therapeutic investigation. Fecal Incontinence will be defined as at least 1 episode of solid or liquid stool leakage per week. All patients will provide a detailed history and undergo physical examination, structural (colonoscopy within 10 years) and anorectal manometry. Once eligible for screening, they will sign a consent form and maintain a 2-week prospective stool diary. If the diary confirms Fecal Incontinence and the inclusion criteria are met, they will be enrolled into the study.

After enrollment, patients will be randomized to receive either office-based biofeedback therapy or home-training.

Office-Training: Patients randomized to receive office-based biofeedback therapy will receive an outpatient treatment of neuromuscular pelvic-floor conditioning using biofeedback techniques. In order to improve the pelvic floor muscle coordination and abdominal effort during defecation, patients will be taught pelvic floor and abdominal muscle coordination exercise. Here, the patients are taught to perform kegal-type exercises as well as distend the abdomen by inhaling slowly and then to hold their breath for at least 15 seconds. They are asked to practice this maneuver for 20 minutes, two or three times a day. Patients will be asked to attend the motility laboratory, approximately once every week. Biofeedback therapy will be performed at these clinic office visits by placing a manometry probe that consists of three pressure sensors and a balloon into the anorectum. The pressure sensors are located at 1cm and 2.5 cm from the anal verge and the rectal sensor at 9cm. A 4 cm long latex balloon will be fashioned around the rectal sensor. After probe placement, the patient will remain clothed and seated on a commode in front of a monitor throughout the study.

Anal and pelvic floor muscle training: The goal is to improve the strength coordination and isolation of pelvic floor muscles. Firstly, patients are instructed to isolate the anal sphincter and puborectalis muscles and improve its strength by using modified Kegel exercises in the sitting or lying position with a probe inserted. Visual and verbal feedback techniques are used to reinforce the maneuvers, as they are being performed. The anal and rectal pressure changes displayed on the monitor provides visual feedback to the patient. The verbal feedback is provided by the therapist and consists of either complimenting the patient for performing a correct maneuver or rectifying any errors. The patient is instructed to squeeze and to maintain the squeeze for as long as possible. During the maneuver, the patient observes the monitor and is educated about the changes in anal pressure/EMG activity. For comparison, a normal recording is shown. As the sphincter strength improves, the patient is encouraged to maintain a voluntary contraction for at least 30 seconds. Patients are instructed not to use their abdominal or gluteal muscles to achieve a voluntary squeeze. After a few sessions, the patient is encouraged to perform these maneuvers without visual feedback. The patient is also instructed to perform squeeze exercises at home for at least 20 minutes, two to three times a day, and to perform about 20 squeeze maneuvers per session. Training may be discontinued when patients demonstrate: A reduction in the number of incontinence episodes and improvement in anal squeeze pressure and recto-anal coordination when squeezing. Patients also receive sensory-motor coordination training. The objective here is to achieve a maximum voluntary squeeze in less than 1 second after inflation of a rectal balloon and to control the reflex anal relaxation by consciously contracting the sphincter muscles.

Those randomized to receive home-training will first receive advice regarding standard treatment for fecal incontinence as described previously. Also, they will be asked to attend the motility lab every two weeks to check on the training parameter and recheck the electrical stimulation intensity if it is still appropriate for the training.

During this session, they will be educated regarding the use of the home-trainer device. After general instructions, the investigators will place a reusable, manometry attached with electrical transducer probe into their rectum. Patients will be fitted with Velcro straps that the research team will assist in fitting the patient for. These Velcro straps will allow the probe to stay in place so that the patient will not be required to hold the probe in place throughout the entire training session and thus free up their dominant hand. The probe will be connected to a hand- held pressure sensing device and battery charged monitor with color illuminations to indicate the patient's response.

This is an FDA approved device for use in fecal incontinence. Next, the patient will be asked to lay down on the side of their non-dominant hand, and with their dominant hand they will inflate the manometry probe to a level they consider comfortable, tolerable and ""full"". If the patient reports this feeling to be tolerable for sustained daily exercise, this volume level will be recorded and maintained for their first two weeks of at home training. Patients will then self-stimulate electrical transducers on the probe to a level they consider tolerable for sustained at-home exercise. This level will also be used for their electrical stimulation throughout their first two weeks of in-home training. At this time the patient is ready to begin their first training session. The device will provide voice-guided instructions for the patients self-directed biofeedback exercise, as well as visual and audio feedback during these pelvic floor muscle toning exercises. Thus, by observing the number of lights that are activated, the patient receives instant feedback about their performance. Initially, the electrical simulations will be set at the highest initial comfortable level for most individuals. Thereafter, at subsequent office visits, appropriate adjustments will be made and suitable targets designed for each patient to achieve the desired goal of pelvic floor strengthening.

The patient will be instructed by the InTone device's training paradigm, at least twice a day and practice a minimum of 20 minutes of 10 second sustained squeezing then follow by 5 minutes of rectal electrical stimulation with the device.

After each use, the probe can be rinsed with soap and water and reused. The training device is battery powered and can be recharged. Once charged the power lasts for at least 30 days and should facilitate the use of this device between office follow-up sessions.

Patient compliance will be automatically monitored and stored in the device recorder. After two weeks of home-training, the patients will return for a follow up assessment and exercise compliance will be reviewed. Based on their progress, newer targets will be set by adjusting the electrical stimulation levels of the training device. During this visit, any other problems or issues will also be addressed. Four weeks later they will be asked to return again and during this visit a repeat anorectal manometry assessment will be performed and patients will complete post-treatment questionnaires.",Augusta University,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,33.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,TREATMENT,,,TRIPLE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Because of these factors and the high cost of treatment, it impacts social economics highly. Chronic pain is caused by wind-up effect of the nervous system which the inhibitory signals are impaired. The nervous systems is therefore tuned up. Mindfulness based pain management helps lower this wind-up effect by noticing self, to observe and release stress.

d9e2c6f272a2c7ea,NCT07244991,Effect of MI Paste Plus™ on Streptococcus Mutans and White Spot Lesions in Fixed Orthodontics,Effect of MI Paste Plus™ on Streptococcus Mutans Counts and White Spot Lesions in Patients With Fixed Orthodontic Appliances: A Triple-Blind Clinical Trial,MIPASTEORTHO,CEEI25_585-Cardenal Herrera,"Background This study is part of a doctoral research project at Universidad Cardenal Herrera CEU (Spain), directed by Prof. Santiago Arias de Luxán and conducted by doctoral candidate Shirli Kelmendi within the PhD program in Translational Medicine.

Fixed orthodontic appliances complicate oral hygiene by creating retention areas that favor bacterial colonization and alter microbial balance. These conditions increase plaque accumulation and Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) proliferation in saliva and plaque. The frequent low-pH environment favors aciduric bacteria such as S. mutans and lactobacilli, promoting enamel demineralization and formation of white spot lesions (WSLs) or cavitations. WSLs appear as opaque white areas due to subsurface mineral loss, mainly in the gingival third of the crown. They may develop as early as one month after bracket placement, while in patients without appliances, progression occurs after at least six months. Increased S. mutans levels have been reported as early as six weeks after treatment start. Risk factors include poor brushing, lack of floss or rinse use, time since last cleaning, and presence of caries or lesions.

Intervention MI Paste Plus (GC, Japan) is a remineralizing cream with 0.20% sodium fluoride (900 ppm) and 10% CPP-ACP (RECALDENT™), providing calcium and phosphate stabilized by casein phosphopeptides. It has antibacterial and remineralizing effects, suitable during or after orthodontic treatment to prevent or reduce WSLs.

Objective To evaluate whether MI Paste Plus during fixed orthodontic treatment reduces S. mutans counts in saliva and/or WSL incidence.

Study Design A prospective, triple-blind, randomized clinical trial, approved by the Ethics Committee of the Ministry of Health of Albania and the Ethics Committee for Human Research of Universidad Cardenal Herrera CEU, Spain.

The study will include 200 patients (100 per group) from two orthodontic clinics in Tirana, Albania. Participants will be stratified by age, risk level, and appliance type, then randomized by third parties.

Outcome Measures Primary variables: S. mutans counts in saliva and number of WSLs after 3 months.

Standardized saliva collection, culturing, and bacterial quantification ensure consistency. Clinical assessments will be performed at 1 and 3 months using QRay Cam Pro (Inspektor Systems, Netherlands) for quantitative fluorescence and ICDAS for visual inspection.

Data will be analyzed using SPSS/R Commander software.","Fixed orthodontic appliances are among the most common treatments in contemporary dentistry, yet they significantly modify the oral environment and create plaque-retentive areas that favor bacterial colonization. Brackets, ligatures, and auxiliary components increase the difficulty of oral hygiene and shift the ecological balance of the dental biofilm, favoring aciduric and acidogenic organisms such as Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans). Repeated exposure of dental plaque to a low pH inhibits acid-sensitive species and promotes S. mutans and lactobacilli, whose metabolic activity produces lactic acid and leads to enamel demineralization. Clinically, this presents as white-spot lesions (WSLs), the earliest visible stage of dental caries. Such lesions may appear within one month of appliance placement, whereas comparable demineralization in patients without orthodontic devices usually requires six months or longer. WSLs compromise esthetics and tooth integrity and may persist after orthodontic treatment ends, making early prevention essential.

Fluoride remains the most validated anti-caries agent, and the combination of fluoride with casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) enhances remineralization by maintaining calcium and phosphate in bioavailable form. MI Paste Plus (GC Corporation, Japan) is a topical cream containing 10% CPP-ACP and 0.20% sodium fluoride (≈900 ppm F-), which releases calcium, phosphate, and fluoride ions that penetrate enamel, support remineralization, and inhibit bacterial ATPase activity. Although promising, further rigorously designed, adequately powered randomized clinical trials are needed to determine whether MI Paste Plus reduces salivary S. mutans levels and prevents WSLs during early orthodontic treatment. This doctoral research project aims to fill this gap.

The main objectives are to determine whether daily use of MI Paste Plus alters salivary S. mutans counts after one and three months of fixed orthodontic treatment and whether it prevents or reduces the incidence and severity of WSLs during the same period. Secondary objectives include assessing the relationship between oral hygiene risk status and baseline S. mutans levels or WSL prevalence, and examining whether age, hygiene risk, or appliance type modifies these outcomes. Null hypotheses state that MI Paste Plus does not significantly affect S. mutans levels or WSL development and that age, hygiene level, and appliance type do not modify these results.

This prospective, triple-blind, parallel-group randomized controlled clinical trial will take place in two private orthodontic polyclinics in Tirana, Albania. Ethical approval has been obtained from the Ministry of Health of Albania (Report No. 66/18, April 4, 2024) and from Universidad Cardenal Herrera CEU (May 12, 2025). All procedures comply with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice, GDPR, the Spanish LOPD, and Albanian data protection law.

A sample of 200 patients (100 per group) will provide \>90% power at α = 0.05 to detect moderate between-group differences, allowing for 10% attrition. Eligible participants will be 5-45 years old, beginning fixed orthodontic treatment, able to comply with procedures, and providing informed consent or assent. Exclusion criteria include systemic conditions affecting salivary flow, antimicrobial use within four weeks, allergies to milk proteins or fluoride, extensive restorations preventing enamel evaluation, or inability to attend follow-ups.

Participants will be stratified by age (≤15 or \>15 years), oral hygiene risk (good or poor), and appliance type, then randomized 1:1 using a computer-generated list prepared by the study statistician. Allocation concealment will use sealed opaque envelopes and coded containers prepared by an independent hygienist. Test and placebo gels are identical in appearance, texture, and packaging. Participants, clinical evaluators, and microbiologists will remain blinded until data lock.

The test group will apply MI Paste Plus nightly for three months after toothbrushing. The control group will apply an inactive bioadhesive gel in the same manner. All participants will continue brushing with fluoridated toothpaste. Adherence will be monitored by daily logs and weighing returned containers.

Assessments occur at baseline (T0), one month (T1 ± 7 days), and three months (T2 ± 14 days). Clinical evaluation of WSLs will be performed using ICDAS. Teeth will be cleaned and dried for approximately five seconds using compressed air to enhance visibility of early changes. A dental operating light, mirror, and blunt probe will be used to classify surfaces from 0 to 6. Surfaces with ICDAS 0 at baseline will be considered sound; those that become ICDAS 1 or 2 at follow-up will be classified as new WSLs. For surfaces with ICDAS 1-2 at baseline, changes over time will indicate progression, stability, or improvement.

Quantitative Light-Induced Fluorescence (QLF™) imaging using the Q-Ray Cam Pro (Inspektor Systems, Netherlands) will complement ICDAS. QLF detects demineralized enamel as dark areas due to fluorescence loss and identifies porphyrin-producing bacterial activity as red/orange fluorescence. White-spot analysis will be performed in the software by activating the White Spot Analysis wizard. The system automatically generates several quantitative parameters, including ΔF (% fluorescence loss), ΔF max, ΔF Average, lesion area (WS Area), and porphyrin fluorescence metrics (ΔR, ΔR max, ΔR area). Although all parameters support clinical interpretation, only ΔF (%) will serve as a registered outcome measure. Negative ΔF values indicate demineralization, while changes in ΔF, WS Area, and ΔR patterns over time allow detection of new lesions and assessment of whether existing lesions progress, stabilize, or remineralize.

Stimulated saliva samples will be collected at least two hours after eating or brushing, refrigerated at 4 °C, and processed within 24 hours. Serial dilutions will be plated on TYCSB medium and incubated anaerobically for 72 hours. Colonies will be subcultured, identified using API 20 Strep, and quantified using standard CFU calculations. Two microbiologists will count plates independently.

Primary outcomes include salivary S. mutans counts and the presence, number, and severity of WSLs based on ICDAS and QLF ΔF values at T1 and T2. Secondary outcomes include plaque index, DMFT/DMFS, and associations with age, hygiene risk, and appliance type. Analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle. Appropriate parametric or nonparametric tests and mixed-effects models will be used. Missing data will be addressed using multiple imputation.

All data will be recorded on paper CRFs and double-entered into a secure database. Calibration of ICDAS scoring, QLF imaging, and microbiological procedures will occur every six months. Adverse events are expected to be minor. Participants may withdraw at any time. Data confidentiality will follow GDPR, LOPD, and Albanian privacy regulations.

The preparatory phase is 90% complete, including protocol finalization, equipment procurement, staff training, and validation of all clinical and laboratory procedures. Recruitment will occur from November 2025 to June 2027, followed by analysis and dissemination. Results will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals in orthodontics, preventive dentistry, and microbiology, and presented at major conferences.

3a59e7d713b8ddff,NCT07135791,Monitoring Fatigue In Daily Life In Adults With Cerebral Palsy or Acquired Brain Injury,Real-Time Monitoring of Fatigue In Daily Life Among Adults With Cerebral Palsy or Acquired Brain Injury: An Observational Study,,p-2023-14839,"The goal of this observational study is to learn about levels and patterns of fatigue in adults with cerebral palsy (CP) and acquired brain injury (ABI) in daily life.

The main question it aims to answer is: How do adults with CP and ABI experience fatigue in daily life?

Researchers will compare data from CP and ABI with healthy volunteers to see if they experience fatigue differently.

Participants will:

* Monitor their symptoms, mood, and behavior in real-time by completing a brief survey on their mobile phone 10 times a day for seven consecutive days.
* Attend a briefing session the day prior to the seven-day period of real-time monitoring.
* Wear an accelerometer for the seven-day period.
* Complete a daily sleep diary for the seven-day period.
* Receive feedback on their real-time monitoring data, sleep and activity data.","Fatigue is a major problem for adults with cerebral palsy (CP) or acquired brain injury (ABI), and contributes to disability, loss of productivity, and poor quality of life.

Qualitative research indicates that fatigue symptoms are dynamic and context-dependent, and the severity of symptoms can fluctuate throughout the day and from day to day.

People living with fatigue may tire more easily, in response to physical or mental exertion, than people without fatigue. Symptoms of fatigue may worsen dramatically and unexpectedly from one moment to the next. It can be very difficult for people to figure out, why they are suddenly overwhelmed by fatigue and to anticipate when symptoms will worsen again.

To help people manage their fatigue, assessment and treatment approaches need to encompass the daily fluctuations and their interaction over time with activities of daily living.

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a well-established method for capturing everyday experiences, including thoughts and behaviors, in their immediate context. As they go about their everyday lives, respondents are prompted multiple times a day, on a mobile device, to answer a brief set of questions about their momentary, ""here and now"", experience, e.g., ""how happy are you right now?"". On traditional self-report instruments, such as questionnaires, rating scales, and diaries, respondents are required to recall information or report on their beliefs and attitudes, which introduce risks of bias to the assessment attributable to memory limitations, personal beliefs, and self-perception. By sampling everyday experiences in real-time, EMA reduces these biases and errors.

The longitudinal nature of EMA even allows for assessment of dynamic processes and interactions that occur over short periods of time. Such fine-grained data are crucial for understanding how and why symptoms change during the day and to identify circumstances that may worsen or mitigate fatigue. This may lead to better treatment and symptom management.

A few studies in CP and ABI have demonstrated the feasibility and prospect of using EMA to capture the dynamics of fatigue. However, evidence is scarce regarding factors of everyday life that exacerbate or mitigate fatigue, although this information is essential for effective management strategies. Qualitative research indicates that several potential triggers of fatigue may be similar across CP and ABI.

Primary Objective:

1. To identify patterns of fatigue and antecedents of symptom exacerbation in daily life of adults with CP and ABI.

   Secondary Objectives:
2. To compare the dynamics of fatigue across CP, ABI, and neurotypical controls.
3. To identify factors in daily life that correlate with exacerbating fatigue symptoms.
4. To explore how physical activity, rest, and sleep influence fatigue patterns.

Design: We will use an intensive longitudinal observational study design. Participants will be asked to monitor in real-time for seven consecutive days. Notifications will pop up on their smartphone 10 times a day, and participants will be prompted to answer a brief survey about ""how they are doing"", ""what they are doing"", ""where they are"", and ""who they are with"", when they received the notification.

Participants will wear an accelerometer on their least affected thigh, and they will be asked to complete a sleep diary every morning in the seven-day period. The day prior to real-time monitoring, participants will meet with a research assistant to be instructed in the EMA protocol.

One week after real-time monitoring, participants will be invited to a feedback session, where the results of real-time monitoring of fatigue, activity, and sleep will be presented and discussed.

We will compare three groups of participants: Adults with CP, adults with ABI, and healthy volunteers without neurological conditions.

Participants with CP will be recruited via a public online announcement on the Elsass Foundation's website.

Participants with ABI will be recruited via two specialised brain injury rehabilitation centers (Vejlefjord Rehabilitering and Center for Rehabilitation of Brain Injury).

Healthy volunteers for the control group were initially planned to be recruited via the social network of the participants with CP or ABI. From August 2025, recruitment will be advertised publicly through social media platforms of the Neurorehabilitation Research and Knowledge Centre, Copenhagen University Hospital - Rigshospitalet (including newsletter, LinkedIn, and announcement on the webpage). The call for healthy volunteers will also be promoted through advocacy organizations for individuals with cerebral palsy or acquired brain injury, e.g., via social media platforms or their websites.","Rigshospitalet, Denmark",OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,OBSERVATIONAL,False,ESTIMATED,120.0,,,,,COHORT,PROSPECTIVE,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

However, plasma concentration of efavirenz may widely vary between different subjects that receive the same dose of the drug (interindividual variability).

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) signifies individualised pharmacological dosing, based on the plasma levels that each patient presents. This strategy has been broadly used in the field of the treatment of other medical conditions and is acquiring growing interest in the field of antiretroviral treatment. Thus, the use of TDM for the treatment of naïve patients with nelfinavir or with indinavir has translated into an increase in the proportion of individuals with suppressed viral load and also into a reduction in HAART-induced adverse events . However, data on the utility of the therapeutic monitoring of the levels of efavirenz in HIV-infected patients are very scant.

The study aims to identify high risk patients, who may benefit from thromboprophylaxis (blood thinning medication) to prevent such clots forming.
* To do this we will collect data on 3500 patients who present with lower limb injury requiring immobilisation to the Emergency Departments of the six hospitals named.
* We will assess their risk factors for venous thrombosis at the time of presentation and contact them at twelve weeks to assess if they have had a VTE in order to develop a risk scoring system which can be used to predict the likelihood of VTE development
* This risk scoring system can then be used to identify high risk patients who may benefit from thromboprophylaxis.","Currently, there is wide variation in the provision of venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis for patients who suffer lower limb trauma and require lower limb immobilisation. Current United Kingdom guidelines recommend assessing competing risks of VTE and bleeding followed by shared decision-making with the patient on prescription of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis (VTE thromboprophylaxis). However, current American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines do not recommend VTE thromboprophylaxis for this group. The largest study carried out to date, the Prevention of Thrombosis after Lower Leg Plaster Cast (POT-CAST) randomised controlled trial 1 identified a very low rate of VTE (1.8%) in the non-intervention arm. This study concluded that thromboprophylaxis was not justified for patients with lower limb trauma who required lower limb immobilisation. However, it recommended that further studies are required to see if it is possible to identify a high risk cohort of patients who may benefit from VTE thromboprophylaxis. No large prospective study has been published to date to assess if it is possible to identify this high risk group.

The Multiple Environmental and Genetic Assessment of risk factors for venous thrombosis (MEGA) study was a case-control study designed to identify risk factors for a first VTE. A sub-analysis of this study reviewed 230 patients who had lower limb trauma with cast immobilisation who developed VTE. Based on this data a risk assessment score was derived (termed ""L-TRiP"" \[Leiden-Thrombosis Risk Prediction for patients with cast immobilization\] score) in order to identify high risk patients who may benefit from VTE prophylaxis. However, this risk assessment tool has not been prospectively validated in a study.

We have carried out a pilot study to assess the feasibility of a large scale, adequately powered multi-centre study aimed at prospective identification of a high VTE-risk group of patients. This study was presented at the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis meeting in Berlin in 2017.5 Utilizing data from this pilot study, we now aim to perform a multi-centre study with sufficient power to determine whether it is feasible to identify a high risk group of patients with lower limb trauma requiring immobilisation who will benefit from thromboprophylaxis The POT-CAST study determined that the rate of venous thrombo-embolism (VTE) in patients with lower limb trauma requiring a cast was 1.8%. This low rate does not justify VTE prophylaxis for all patients who require a cast. However there may be a high risk group with a rate of VTE high enough to suggest that consideration of VTE prophylaxis may be appropriate. This study will prospectively gather risk factor data on patients at the time of initial presentation post trauma with follow up at 12 weeks to identify those patients who have experienced a symptomatic VTE episode. This data will then be used to identify a group with a high VTE risk which future studies can utilise to target this high risk group to assess if VTE prophylaxis is of benefit.",University of Limerick,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,OBSERVATIONAL,False,ESTIMATED,3500.0,,,,,COHORT,PROSPECTIVE,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Changes of antiretroviral therapy within the prior 12 weeks for toxicity/convenience reasons are allowed (as long as participants are on a stable regimen for 4 weeks per Section 3.1.11). However, if changes in anti-HIV therapy are due to inadequate HIV control and occurred within the 3 months prior to protocol consent, the patient is not eligible until 12 weeks after optimal control is reached.
* If HIV positive, must have been on a STABLE anti-retroviral therapy for at least 4 weeks. The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) efavirenz and etravirine are moderate CYP3A4 inducers which will reduce ixazomib exposure and are therefore prohibited. Potential participants requiring change of antiretroviral therapy to avoid moderate to strong CYP3A4 inducers or to pursue better HIV management with an alternate antiretroviral regimen should defer enrollment until completing 4 weeks of the new ART regimen. There should be no intention to change the regimen for the duration of the study.
* HIV positive participants must not show recent improvement in KS on ART alone that may confound response evaluation, within the following parameters:

  * If on ART 12 to 24 weeks, participants must show a burden of disease requiring further systemic KS-directed treatment (i.e. advanced cutaneous disease, presence of lymphedema or asymptomatic visceral disease, painful lesions) or evidence of KS progression:
  * i.e. any new lesion(s);
  * spreading of lesions by any measurable degree;
  * development of ulceration;
  * worsening edema documented by circumferential measure of limb or body;
  * increase in symptoms such as pain, including negative psychological impact;
  * any degree of disease worsening by imaging that would prompt expert assessment to recommend further systemic treatment with delay
  * If on ART for \>24 weeks, must show no evidence of regression in last 8 weeks
* Patients who have residual active KS lesions (not merely tattoo effect) after receipt of recent KS-directed therapy are eligible to participate even if there was no interval progression since completion of therapy as long as: (1) the degree of residual disease merits systemic therapy (i.e. advanced cutaneous disease, presence of lymphedema or asymptomatic visceral disease, painful lesions)); and (2) at least 4 weeks have passed since receipt of the most recent KS-directed therapy.

Exclusion Criteria:

Patients who are on chronic use of strong CYP3A inducers must come off 14 days before receiving ixazomib treatment. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list; medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the participant will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be prescribed or if the participant is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal product
* Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection; uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions, including uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina, or myocardial infarction within the past 6 months; or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

* Participants with a second prior or concurrent malignancy that has a natural history or treatment regimen that has the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the investigational regimen
* Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ixazomib is expected to cause fetal harm if used during pregnancy. It is not known if ixazomib is excreted into breast milk, but due to the potential for serious adverse events in a nursing infant, breastfeeding must be discontinued during therapy and for 90 days after the last ixazomib dose
* Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) before entering the study
* Participants who have not recovered from other adverse events due to prior anti-cancer therapy (i.e., have residual toxicity \> grade 1), excluding alopecia
* Participants who are seropositive for hepatitis B (defined by a positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen \[HBsAg\]). All participants will be required to be screened for hepatitis B. Participants with resolved infection (i.e. participants who are HBsAg negative but positive for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) and/or antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) must be screened using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) measurement of HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels. Participants who are PCR positive will be excluded. EXCEPTION: Participants with serologic findings suggestive of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination (anti-HBs positivity as the only serologic marker) AND a known history of prior HBV vaccination, do not need to be tested for HBV DNA by PCR

The study is a prospective, randomized controlled phase III trial aimed to test the efficacy and safety of Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, for front line treatment of locally-advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma.The device is an experimental, portable, battery operated device for chronic administration of alternating electric fields (termed TTFields or TTF) to the region of the malignant tumor, by means of surface, insulated electrode arrays.","PAST PRE-CLINICAL AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCE:

The effect of the electric fields (TTFields, TTF) has demonstrated significant activity in in vitro and in vivo pancreatic adenocarcinoma pre-clinical models both as a single modality treatment and in combination with chemotherapies. TTFields have been demonstrated to act synergistically with taxanes and have been shown to be additive when combined with other chemotherapies including gemcitabine. In addition, TTFields have shown to inhibit metastatic spread of malignant melanoma in in vivo experiment.

In a pilot study, 40 patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma received gemcitabine together with TTFields (150 kHz) or gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel together with TTFields (150 kHz) applied to the abdomen until disease progression. The combination was well tolerated and the only device-related adverse event was contact dermatitis.

In addition, a phase III trial of Optune® (200 kHz) as monotherapy compared to active chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma patients showed TTFields to be equivalent to active chemotherapy in extending survival, associated with minimal toxicity, good quality of life, and activity within the brain (14% response rate) (Stupp R., et al., EJC 2012). Finally, a phase III trial of Optune® combined with maintenance temozolomide compared to maintenance temozolomide alone has shown that combined therapy led to a significant improvement in both progression free survival and overall survival in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma without the addition of high grade toxicity and without decline in quality of life (Stupp R., et al., JAMA 2017).

DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL:

All patients included in this trial are patients with locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma. In addition, all patients must meet all eligibility criteria.

Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:

1. Patients receive gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in combination with TTFields using the NovoTTF-200T System.
2. Patients receive gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel without TTFields.

Patients will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio. Baseline tests will be performed in patients enrolled in both arms. If assigned to the NovoTTF-200T group, the patients will be treated continuously with the device until progression in the abdomen. On both arms, patients who have progression outside the abdomen will switch to a second line treatment according to local practice.

SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND:

Electric fields exert forces on electric charges similar to the way a magnet exerts forces on metallic particles within a magnetic field. These forces cause movement and rotation of electrically charged biological building blocks, much like the alignment of metallic particles seen along the lines of force radiating outwards from a magnet.

Electric fields can also cause muscles to twitch and if strong enough may heat tissues. TTFields are alternating electric fields of low intensity. This means that they change their direction repetitively many times a second. Since they change direction very rapidly (150 thousand times a second), they do not cause muscles to twitch, nor do they have any effects on other electrically activated tissues in the body (brain, nerves and heart). Since the intensities of TTFields in the body are very low, they do not cause heating.

The breakthrough finding made by Novocure was that finely tuned alternating fields of very low intensity, now termed TTFields (Tumor Treating Fields), cause a significant slowing in the growth of cancer cells. Due to the unique geometric shape of cancer cells when they are multiplying, TTFields cause electrically-charged cellular components of these cells to change their location within the dividing cell, disrupting their normal function and ultimately leading to cell death. In addition, cancer cells also contain miniature building blocks which act as tiny motors in moving essential parts of the cells from place to place. TTFields interfere with the normal orientation of these tiny motors related to other cellular components since they are electrically-charged as well. As a result of these two effects, tumor cell division is slowed, results in cellular death or reverses after continuous exposure to TTFields.

Other cells in the body (normal healthy tissues) are affected much less than cancer cells since they multiply at a much slower rate if at all. In addition TTFields can be directed to a certain part of the body, leaving sensitive areas out of their reach. Finally, the frequency of TTFields applied to each type of cancer is specific and may not damage normally dividing cells in healthy tissues.

In conclusion, TTFields hold the promise of serving as a brand new treatment for pancreatic adenocarcinoma with very few side effects.",NovoCure Ltd.,INDUSTRY,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,571.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,TREATMENT,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

There appears to be a transfer from eating disorders to substance misuse addiction in post-treatment of obesity, particularly in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery.

The misuse of addictive substances most concerned by this transfer of addiction in the post-treatment of obesity, particularly after bariatric surgery, seems to be the misuse of alcohol.

The VIAMI-Trial.,,2000B026,The VIAMI-trial investigates the effects of balloon angioplasty with stenting of the infarct-vessel in the early phase after acute myocardial infarction. The study concerns patients who have residual viable tissue in the infarct-area after being treated with thrombolysis. It is postulated that only patients with remaining viable tissue are at high-risk for recurrent infarction or anginal attacks and that stenting of the infarct-vessel will reduce this risk considerably.,"Earlier studies have shown that routine angioplasty of the infarct-related coronary artery soon after thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction did not result in a clinical benefit. This finding emphasizes the importance to select a subgroup of patients with a recent myocardial infarction, who will really benefit from angioplasty of the infarct-related artery.

Several studies have demonstrated that the presence of viability in the infarct-area early after acute myocardial infarction imposes an increased risk of new cardiac events like recurrent infarction, angina pectoris and need for coronary interventions. Therefore, it is postulated that only patients with viability in the infarct-area will benefit from angioplasty early after acute myocardial infarction.

In the VIAMI-trial patients who are admitted to the hospital with an acute myocardial infarction and who did not undergo immediate coronary angioplasty, will undergo viability testing by dobutamine-echocardiography within 3 days of admission. Patients with unequivocal signs of viability in the infarct-area will then be randomized to an invasive or a conservative treatment strategy. In the invasive strategy patients will undergo coronary angiography with the intention to perform balloon angioplasty with stenting of the infarct-related coronary artery, with concomitant use of the intravenous platelet inhibitor abciximab. In the conservative group patients will undergo coronary angiography and angioplasty only when new impending infarction or recurrent ischemia is present. In the invasive group balloon angioplasty will be performed as soon as possible after randomization. Patients without viability will not be randomized,but will participate as a control group.",Netherlands Heart Foundation,OTHER,,INTERVENTIONAL,,,300.0,RANDOMIZED,SINGLE_GROUP,,PREVENTION,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Self-management guidelines include maintenance of logbooks for blood glucose, physical activity, and dietary intake, that affect glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and acute complications. The proposed study will evaluate whether mobile messaging for maintaining log books for blood glucose or e-device use for step count will modify HbA1c levels to be examined at three and six months after enrollment. In addition, episodes of acute complications and blood glucose variability will be correlated with daily log book maintenance and step counts.","Type 1 diabetes (T1D) occurs due to destruction of insulin producing beta cells in pancreas. T1D usually occurs in children and young individuals, and requires continuous blood glucose monitoring for adjustment of insulin dosage on a daily basis. Incidence of T1D has been increasing over the past three decades. Hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis episodes are common adverse effects due to irregular monitoring of daily blood glucose. It is a big challenge in developed as well as developing countries to live with T1D due to less optimal use of timely entry in logbook for self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). Current guidelines recommend SMBG use in all patients with diabetes. According to a study, increased daily frequency of SMBG was significantly associated with lower glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) along with added benefits of fewer acute complications among children and adolescents. Available literature from Pakistan highlights non-adherence of T1D patients to recommended dietary advice (58.5%), physical activity (42.3%) and prescribed insulin regimen (88.1%). Use of mobile applications has been shown to increase the medication adherence and use of self-blood glucose testing. Increased daily step count by T1D patients helped to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. A wearable e-device accompanied with an application (Fitbit App) tracks step count by recording data in mobile application. HbA1C levels acts as an indicator for the glycemic control and correlates with complications. However, HbA1C cannot determine the daily variability of blood glucose, thus SMBG can help predict the average daily risk reduction in T1D complications. The proposed study will address the adherence to standard protocols for maintaining home based records by patients and caregivers and insulin therapy, optimizing the quarterly HbA1C levels.",Aga Khan University,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,120.0,RANDOMIZED,FACTORIAL,"A factorial design approach will be taken to study the lifestyle change for self-management of T1D.

Performance declines are more pronounced in hot conditions or after prolonged strenuous activity such as exercise. Most individuals drink less than their sweat losses during activity, while some individuals overdrink and develop a sodium deficiency. Water and electrolyte balance must be restored as part of the recovery process after any activity that causes sweating. Plain water causes a decrease in plasma sodium concentration and osmolality, which reduces the desire to drink and increases urine production. Unless the volume ingested exceeds the loss, individuals are in net negative fluid balance throughout the recovery period due to urinary losses. When sodium and potassium are added to rehydration fluids, urine production is reduced in the hours following rehydration. Rehydration is only possible if a volume of fluid equal to or greater than the amount lost through sweat is consumed, together with adequate electrolytes.

A cluster randomized community-based trial was conducted in Padang City, West Sumatra, Indonesia. Subjects are Minagabau women of reproductive age (20-44 y) with dyslipidemia. The subjects were assigned either into FBR group (n=48) that involved in 12-weeks prolonged contact of FBRs promotion or into non-FBR group, that received once nutrition counselling from usual standard of nutrition program. Baseline and end-line lipid profiles, nutritional status, dietary practice and nutrient intake data were assessed through biochemical assessment, anthropometri, and interview structured questionaire.","This study was conducted in two sequential phases. The first stage was a formative phase in the form of observational survey to develop and validate food-based recommendations (FBRs). The second phase was an intervention study to assess the effectiveness of the FBRs in improving dietary practice, the intake of problem nutrient, nutritional status and lipid profile of the subject.

Sample size for intervention per group (n=60/group; 2 groups) was expected to detect mean(±SD) differences in LDL-cholesterol concentration (as an secondary outcome) of 14±20 mg/dL as observed in a previous study in other area, with assumption of 80% power and 25% loss of follow up. Potential subjects were identified prior to dyslipidemia screening before intervention. Field nutritionist and volunteer cadres were requested to identify and list women of reproductive age fulfilling the inclusion criteria living in selected sites. An invitation letter was sent to all identified eligible subjects to visit appointed field laboratory to perform blood measurement. Inform consent was signed by all potential participants before blood measurement.

This study did not compare an intervention group (FBR group) with a true control group, but with a comparison group that received once nutrition counselling from usual nutrition health program (non-FBR group). Drawing on concepts of Plan Behavior Theory, persuasive FBR promotion was designed to influence subjects' attitude, subjective norms, perceive behavior control related to dyslipidemia and dietary management, and intention to change.

Senior citizens living in the community who participate in a humor seminar will have improved health quality of life compared to those not participating in the seminar.
2. Senior citizens living in the community who participate in a humor seminar will have improved general well being compared to those not participating in the seminar
3. Senior citizens living in the community who participate in a humor seminar will have decreased psychological distress compared to those not participating in the seminar","Participants for this study will be chosen from senior centers . All members of the senior centers who can read and write either Hebrew or English and are not cognitively impaired (as assessed by the administrator/social worker in charge of the center) will be asked to participate. It is estimated that between 30-50 members of each senior center will agree to participate. The control group will be chosen by convenience sampling of members from other, different senior centers. These centers will be chosen based on close geographic proximity and similar demographic characteristics to the experimental, humor group, senior centers. The choice of which center will be used for the experimental and control groups will be based on logistic considerations.

This method of sample selection and group assignment were chosen due to several considerations. At present there are approximately 60 participants in the Rishon Lezion Holocaust survivor senior center. It is highly unlikely that all of the members of the center will agree to participate in the study and/or will continue with the entire intervention. Based on a power of .80 and an alpha rate of .05, in order to detect a significant difference between two groups with a moderate effect size, a total of 64 subjects will be necessary for each of the two groups, the experimental and the control each group. Therefore, there are not enough seniors in one center to participate in either groups and additional sites for subject recruitment was found to be necessary.

A second consideration is diffusion of the treatment protocol. It is thought that if both the control and humor groups were recruited from the same senior center, then there would be the possibility that the seniors would discuss among themselves the humor intervention, thereby leading to a diffusion of treatment. In this situation, it might be hard to differentiate between those who participated in the humor and the control group. Therefore, the seniors of the control group would need to be recruited from another senior center.

This process then leads to another issue, namely selection bias, in that the control and humor groups might be different from the outset of the study. Two measures will be taken to decrease this threat to the internal validity of the study. Firstly, an attempt will be made to match the senior centers that will be used to recruit those in the control group with the senior centers used for the humor group, based on geographic location and demographic characteristics. Secondly, both the control and humor groups will be asked to complete the questionnaires at the beginning and at the end of the study. Therefore, differences will be determined between the two groups at two points in time.

Humor Program: The ""Humor as a Way of Life"" program will be comprised of one session per week lasting 2-3 hours per session. The program will take six months to complete. The first three months of the program will be moderated by Mr. Yochanan Waller, a known video producer and humorist. Under Mr Waller's direction, each participant will be requested to relate a humorous story or situation. These sessions will be video recorded. Between each session, Mr Waller will edit each session. At the next session, all of the participants will view all of the stories related during the previous session. Any parts of the videos that are not used for the purpose of the program will be destroyed.

The first four weeks of the program will include strategies to incorporate humor into everyday life. These sessions will be conducted by Mr. Enzo Agada, a known humorist, and his wife, Amalia Garbulsky, a Social Worker. The topic of humor and its impact on everyday life will be presented and discussed. Initially the moderator will tell humorous stories and aim to trigger reactions or comments from the participants about their own personal associations of what they just heard. Participants will be asked about humorous life events and will be asked to share those events with the group. During each session the moderators will generate an atmosphere of mirth and will try to involve as many participants as possible in the discussion. The moderator will act as a stimulant for humor, smiling, and laughter.

At the end of the four months, a large celebration will be conducted where a final video will be shown that summarizes the project.

During the next two months, volunteers will be recruited to transport the participants to other senior centers in groups of 3-4. The participants will share with the seniors the final video and will try and encourage other seniors to use humor in their daily lives.

Instruments: Four questionnaires will be used in this study; a demographic data questionnaire, the RAND Health Survey (Hays, Sherbourne, \& Mazel, 1993), the General Well Being Schedule (Dupuy, 1987)and the Brief Symptom Inventory (Derogatis \& Spencer, 1982).

After institutional ethical review and approval, each potential senior center administrator will be contacted to gain approval for admission to the site to collect data. The principle investigator of the study will oversee and supervise all data collection. All members of each senior center who speak and write Hebrew or English and are cognitively competent (as assessed by the administrator/social worker of each senior center) will be asked to participate. These seniors will be contacted, the study will be described and informed consent obtained. Copies of the informed consent form will be given to each participant. After informed consent was obtained, each participant will fill out the three questionnaires. Data collectors will be available to help participants fill out their forms if necessary. This data collection will take place before the project has begun. Each participant will be asked to write the last four digits of their identity numbers on the form so that follow up questionnaires will be able to be correlated with baseline data. All subjects will fill out all forms at baseline and after six months, after completion of the project. Control subjects will be offered the option of participating in the next humor therapy session whenever possible.

If the results of the GWB questionnaire indicate great psychological distress of the participant, then the administrator/social worker of the senior center will be informed as necessary.

Analysis: Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the sample and results of the RAND and GWB questionnaires.

The primary objective is to assess the therapeutic performance and tolerability of Cerviron® Ovules in postoperative care in patients that underwent surgical removal of benign, cervical lesions. The secondary objective of this clinical investigation is the assessment of performance of the medical device by clinical exam and patients' degree of satisfaction related to the use of the medical device.","Identifying premalignant and benign diseases of the cervix and selecting an appropriate treatment path can be challenging. The adult uterine cervix may exhibit a wide variety of pathologic conditions that include benign entities (eg, cervicitis, hyperplasia, nabothian cysts, cervical polyps, leiomyomas, endometriosis, and congenital abnormalities) as well as malignant lesions, particularly cervical carcinoma.

Cervical lesions range from being visible only with an instrument that augments sight such as a colposcope to being visible by speculum examination or endovaginal ultrasound.

The most frequent types of cervical lesions are:

1\. Cervical polyp Cervical polyps are benign growths, usually protruding from the surface of the cervical canal. They commonly occur during the reproductive years, especially in women over 20 years of age. Cervical polyps are the most common non-cancerous tumour of the cervix.

The cervical polyps may vary in size, shape, and origin. They can present as single or multiple, tear-shaped or lobular, cherry-red, or greyish-white in color, depending on the vascularity of the lesion. The size of the cervical polyp is typically less than three cm in diameter; however, as mentioned earlier, they can vary in size and can be large enough to fill the vagina or be present at the introitus They usually originate in the endocervical canal. Endocervical polyps may be caused by chronic inflammation. They rarely become malignant.

Nabothian cyst Nabothian cysts are a benign gynecological condition in reproductive age without clinical significance. These cysts are at the squamocolumnar junction of the uterine cervix, which is the targeted anatomical area of brush sampling at the time of cervical screening cytology. They are filled with mucus, but they may also contain proteinaceous material, neutrophils, or neutrophil debris. These cysts usually appear superficially and are easily recognized during colposcopy examination. If left untreated, they can induce considerable enlargement of the cervix, which can lead to symptomatology. Other causes of these large cysts include cystic degeneration of uterine leiomyoma and congenital uterine cysts such as mesonephric and paramesonephric cysts and cystic adenomyosis.

Complications of Nabothian cysts include hematometra, labor passage obstruction, rectal compression, abnormal uterine bleeding, specifically in case of giant cysts, and chronic urinary retention by restricting the bladder's outlet or by compressing the pudendal and sacral nerves, thus, disturbing the nerve supply to the detrusor muscle.

Cervical fibroid Cervical fibroids (myomas) start in the muscle tissue of the cervix. They are similar to uterine fibroids but less common. Cervical fibroids may not cause symptoms. The most common symptom is abnormal vaginal bleeding. Pain during intercourse may happen. If the fibroid becomes large, it may partially block the urinary tract and cause urinary drainage problems such as dribbling or urinary retention. If myomas become infected, they may cause pain, bleeding, or a discharge from the vagina.

The recommended treatment in all cases is excision. After surgery, haemostasis and rapid recovery should be promoted with the support of local, re-epithelizing treatments.

Cerviron® ovules Cerviron® ovules is a class IIb medical device used as adjuvant treatment in cervical lesions of mechanical origin. It favors the healing and re-epithelialization processes and reduces the proliferation of endogenous pathogens.

Bismuth subgallate causes shrinkage of damaged tissue by stopping bleeding and promoting tissue healing. Being an insoluble salt and very little absorbed the bismuth subgalate forms a protective film that allows the other components to act locally. ""Through its active ingredient, Bismuth subgallate, Cerviron® ovules exert a protective action on mucous membranes and raw surfaces. Moreover, it provides a strong hemostatic effect, as shown in multiple studies. Moreover, it contains collagen with nutritive, hydrating, healing and trophic effect. Collagen is structurally and functionally a key protein of the extracellular matrix which is also involved in forming the scars during the healing of conjunctive tissues, due to its chemotactic role.

bfd2acef0ae9adf1,NCT00340418,Mechanisms of Lung Allograft Rejection,Mechanisms of Lung Allograft Rejection,,999905182,"This study will explore the ways in which lung transplants are rejected. A series of experiments will evaluate the differences in airway gene expression. Lung transplantation has become an important option for patients with advanced lung disease. More than 10,000 patients have received them to date, and about 1,200 transplant operations are performed worldwide each year. Although short-term survival has continued to improve, the 5-year survival rate is less than 50%. Most posttransplant deaths are directly or directly caused by chronic lung rejection, a condition of scarring that worsens lung function. .

Patients ages 18 and older who have received lung transplants, who are undergoing bronchoscopy as part of the usual care after transplant, and who are not pregnant may be eligible for this study.

Bronchoscopy and other procedures performed during this study are done only by doctors with special training. They will take a total of 30 to 60 minutes. During a bronchoscopy, patients will lie on a flat bed. They will be awake and follow instructions. First they will breathe Xylocaine (lidocaine), an anesthetic mist, for 8 to 10 minutes. That will lessen the discomfort of a small flexible tube called a bronchoscope that will be guided through the back of the patient's mouth or nose and into the breathing tubes. When the flexible tube is placed, patients will not be able to speak. They will receive the medication Versed (midazolam), to make them relaxed and not remember most of the procedure, and fentanyl, to decrease the possibility of feeling pain. These medications will be given through a narrow tube feeding into a small needle placed into a vein in the arm. The risks of the tube placed in the vein include bleeding, swelling, redness, and pain. Side effects from the medications may include stomach upset, heart palpitations (awareness of heartbeat), and changes in blood pressure. Patients will be carefully monitored for heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, and oxygen levels.

During the bronchoscopy, a procedure called bronchoalveolar lavage is done, in which a small amount of germ-free salt water is injected into through the bronchoscope into the lung and immediately suctioned back, thus washing the lining of the airways and checking for infection and rejection of the transplanted lungs. About 1 or 2 tablespoons of fluid will be collected for analysis. Also, an endobronchial brush biopsy may be performed. A small brush removes some of the cells from the surface of the airway. These cells will be sent to a laboratory at Duke University Health system to analyze the signals from the cells that may eventually led to scarring and chronic rejection of the lungs. Then, an endobronchial forceps biopsy is performed, in which one or two small pieces, each about the size of a grain of rice, of the lining of the lung's large airways is removed. A small surgical tool like tweezers is passed into the lung. Risks of biopsies may include bleeding, injury to the lung, or an air leak in the lung.

This study will not have a direct benefit for participants. However, it is hoped that information gathered will enhance researchers' understanding of how lung rejection occurs.","Lung transplantation has emerged as a viable therapeutic option in the care of patients with advanced pulmonary parenchymal and pulmonary vascular disease. Currently, over 10,000 patients have received lung transplantation with approximately 1200 transplant operations performed worldwide each year. Short term survival after lung transplantation has continued to improve since the widespread application of this procedure and one-year survival at most centers now approaches 80%. Unfortunately, long-term outcomes after lung transplantation are disappointing with five-year survival below 50%. Most posttransplant deaths are due directly or indirectly to the development of chronic allograft rejection, which affects approximately 50% of all five-year survivors. Acute rejection is the major risk factor for the development of chronic rejection. Chronic lung rejection leads to a condition of irreversible fibrosis and obliteration of the small to medium size bronchioles known as obliterative bronchiolitis (OB). Very little is known about the pathogenic mechanisms that lead to the development of OB. Furthermore, it is unclear why acute rejection leads to the development of chronic rejection in some but not all patients. In order to better understand the mechanisms of OB we propose a series of experiments designed to evaluate differences in airway gene expression in a series of lung transplant recipients with and without acute rejection.",National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),NIH,,OBSERVATIONAL,,,120.0,,,,,,,,,,"* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

Researchers also hope to find out if giving these drugs together will help shrink or slow the growth of tumors in patients who are considered resistant to platinum drugs. The safety of these drugs will also be studied.","Bortezomib is a drug that turns off certain genes and proteins inside the cancer cell that are responsible for cell growth. Researchers believe that when certain genes and proteins are turned off, the ability of the cancer cell to survive is decreased.

Before treatment starts, participants will have a complete checkup, blood tests, a urine test, a heart test, a chest x-ray, and either a CT scan or MRI scan. Women able to have children must have a negative blood pregnancy test within 14 days of beginning treatment. Blood tests and a complete checkup will also be done before each course of therapy and a month after treatment ends. Approximately 2-3 teaspoons of blood will be obtained for routine blood tests each time blood is drawn during this study.

Participants in this study will receive Bortezomib and carboplatin through a catheter (tube) placed in a vein. This is Day 1 of therapy. Bortezomib is given first (over 5 to 10 seconds) followed by carboplatin (over one hour). Bortezomib is then given alone on Days 4, 8, and 11. There is no treatment given on Days 12-28. One course of therapy is 28 days long and includes one dose of carboplatin and 4 doses of Bortezomib. All treatment is given on an outpatient basis at M. D. Anderson.

There are 4 different dose levels of Bortezomib being studied. The dose of Bortezomib that participants receive will depend on when they are enrolled. It will also depend on whether or not other participants had side effects from their treatment. Up to 6 patients could be treated at each dose.

Before each course of therapy, participants will have a physical exam and blood tests. A CT scan or MRI scan is repeated after Cycles 2 and 4 and at the end of treatment. Participants who have a partial or complete response (the tumor shrinks by more than 50% or disappears completely) will have a repeat CT or MRI 4 weeks later to confirm the response.

Participants may receive up to 8 courses of treatment. If the disease gets worse or if intolerable side effects occur, participants will be taken off study.

This is an investigational study. Bortezomib is approved for use by the FDA, in patients with multiple myeloma. Carboplatin is approved by the FDA, though its use with Bortezomib is experimental.

FAZA is an investigational radiotracer used in PET scans. FAZA PET/MRI will be used to measure hypoxia in sarcoma tissues and will occur for:

Arm A: before neo-adjuvant radiation/chemotherapy treatment; Arm B: before surgery (optional).

After the FAZA PET/MRI scan, patients will be followed up via telephone, 48 hours after the scan, to see if there are any side effects due to FAZA.

Up to 30 patients enrolled in Arm B will receive pimonidazole approximately 16-20 hours before surgery.","Mutliple studies show that hypoxia in sarcoma has been consistently associated with poor treatment outcomes. Subsequently, there has been a study that shows inhibition of hypoxia-induced transcription factor (HIF-1 alpha), with radiation, was effective in disease treatment in pre-clinical models. This shows how important hypoxia was in playing a role in overall disease outcome and survival.

As a means of examining tumor features, such as hypoxia, hybrid PET/MR imaging combines the advantages of MRI's soft-tissue and contrast resolution with PET's functional metabolic capabilities. There have been few reports of using 18F-FDG in diagnostic PET/MRI. with the use of 18F-FAZA in this study, parameters such as diffusion, micro-perfusion, and contrast enhancement (as a surrogate marker for viable tumour tissue) can be simultaneously compared with the FAZA-derived pattern, in a single procedure.

The prevalence of hypogonadism is not known, but is thought to be significant. Results will be adjusted for age and stratified for type of cancer, stage, study site,and presence of opiate use for pain management, which is known to reduce testosterone levels.","Fatigue - extreme tiredness - is associated with cancer as well as its treatment. It has many causes, including the direct effects of the cancer itself, nutritional changes, anemia, changes in activity levels, worry, or, perhaps, hormones such as testosterone. This study is a survey of the amount of testosterone in the blood of men being treated for cancers that are not directly influenced by testosterone (not prostate or testicular tumors).

Testosterone is a hormone that is made by the body from teenage years through adulthood, and helps define male characteristics: sexual function, muscle building, ability to grow hair and deepen the voice. It is believed that the amount of fatigue experienced by men with cancer may be at least and in part due to reduced testosterone levels.

Nemtabrutinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It blocks a protein called BTK, which is present on B-cell (a type of white blood cells) cancers such as mantel cell lymphoma at abnormal levels. This may help keep cancer cells from growing and spreading. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Giving nemtabrutinib with rituximab may kill more cancer cells in patients with mantle cell lymphoma.","PRIMARY OBJECITVE:

The study objective is to evaluate the safety and clinical benefit of NexoBrid in hospitalized children (0-17 years) with deep partial and/or full thickness thermal burns of 1-30% TBSA and to compare NexoBrid to standard of care (SOC).,"A total of 160 patients will be randomized into NexoBrid and SOC treatment (80 patients per arm).

Age distribution will be managed as follows:

* 45 patients 0-23 months old
* 45 patients 24 months-3 years old
* 30 patients 4-11 years old
* 20 patients 12-17 years old The remaining 20 patients will be enrolled to any of the above groups, per their age during enrollment.

The study will be conducted in three stages. In Stage I, at least 24 children age 4-18 years, hospitalized in burn units, with deep partial thickness burns ranging from 1%-30% TBSA, and who meet the entrance criteria, will be enrolled. Upon completion of stage I, a safety analysis will be performed on safety parameters and the results will be evaluated by a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) as defined in the agreed charter. If the DSMB does not have any safety concerns, Stage II will commence, this time enrolling at least 26 additional children aged of 1-18 years according to the study procedures. A DSMB will be convened to assess the safety data of the first 50 patients enrolled at stages 1 \& 2. If the DSMB has not found any safety concerns, stage III will commence in which patients from the age of birth to 18 years will be included (stage III will include 110 remaining patients required to reach a total of 160 patients).

Following the enrollment of a subject to the study and prior to randomization, physicians will define one or more Target Wounds (TWs) per subject according to TWs definition. All subjects' DPT and FT burns that fit the specified criteria are intended to receive study treatment per randomized study arm and therefore, must be designated as TWs.

Prior to eschar removal treatment with NexoBrid or SOC subjects will be medicated with appropriate analgesia and undergo wound cleansing and dressing of all wounds with antibacterial solutions. Following wound cleansing and antibacterial treatments, subjects will undergo the eschar removal process as per treatment assignment (NexoBrid or SOC, following randomization). Subsequent to eschar removal, all wounds will be assessed and treated in the same manner, in accordance with post-eschar removal wound care strategy. Furthermore, subjects will undergo daily assessments (Vital signs (VS) and pain assessments) for one week and weekly assessments thereafter, until wound closure. Following wound closure, subjects will be followed up at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and after that, at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months (for a blinded assessment of cosmesis, function and QoL evaluation).

The majority of neonatal infections occur in the first two weeks of life, when the epidermal barrier is immature and functionally compromised. Topical application of antiseptics until the skin matures could theoretically prevent skin colonization and reduce the incidence of systemic infections in neonates. Chlorhexidine, a broad-spectrum antiseptic used frequently for umbilical cord care in neonates, is now being evaluated for topical application to the skin. Hospital-based studies, involving predominantly term infants, have shown reductions in skin flora8 and a reduction in the incidence of sepsis following topical chlorhexidine application. In a community-based study in Nepal, a single skin cleansing with 0.25% chlorhexidine resulted in reduction in mortality among low birth weight infants; though the mechanism of the impact could not be determined, it was presumably due to increased susceptibility to transcutaneous sepsis in the low birth weight group.

Since the risk of infection in neonates is inversely related to their gestation, it is essential to evaluate the effect and the mechanism of such intervention in preterm neonates. These infants are, however, more prone to develop skin reactions following use of topical antiseptics. Preterm infants are also more prone to develop hypothermia following bathing/cleansing with antiseptic solution(s).

Since few studies have evaluated the effects of topical application of chlorhexidine in preterm infants admitted in a health care facility, we conducted the present study to examine if single skin cleansing with 0.25% chlorhexidine immediately after birth affects skin condition, temperature, and colonization in hospitalized preterm low birth weight infants.",All India Institute of Medical Sciences,OTHER,,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,60.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,PREVENTION,,,TRIPLE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

The primary source for the blood supply of the head of the femur is the deep branch of the medial femoral circumflex artery. Loder described a classification for Slipped capital femoral epiphysis based on ability of the child to walk or not(walking=stable, non-walking=unstable).","In slipped capital femoral epiphyses (SCFE), the severity of slippage correlates with poor long-term clinical outcome scores and radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis . In situ fixation of higher-grade SCFE has a low surgical risk and has been advocated by authors who believe the deformed hip has the potential to remodel with some restoration of the disturbed anatomic axes ; however, the remodeling potential remains controversial . Despite remodeling, the head-neck offset will remain abnormal . This is the cause of potential impingement of the femoral neck with the acetabular cartilage . Impingement in SCFE has been associated with damage of the acetabular cartilage, which may explain the early onset of osteoarthritis after SCFE .

Ganz et al. described a technique of surgical dislocation of hip involving trochanteric flip osteotomy and anterior capsulotomy preserving the blood supply to femoral head. The technique is based on extensive study of blood supply to the proximal femur.

3433216ffd084316,NCT00957190,The DIOXXACT Trial(Diurnal IOP and OBF Xalatan vs Xalatan And Cosopt Trial),"Change in Optic Nerve Head Blood Flow,Optic Nerve Topography and Diurnal Fluctuation of Intraocular Pressure and Pulsatile Ocular Blood Flow in Glaucoma:Cosopt and Xalatan vs Xalatan Alone",DIOXXACT,157-00,"Diurnal and intervisit fluctuations in IOP are strongly associated with progression of open angle glaucoma and therefore need to be minimized. Control of diurnal fluctuations of IOP with different ocular hypotensive medications has been studied in some detail. But how do IOP changes contribute to progressive glaucomatous optic nerve damage? It is reasonable to assume that there are two principal effects of IOP changes. First, IOP fluctuations result in changes in the stresses and strains on the ONH which in turn result in morphological changes to the ONH. These morphological changes could in turn result in stretching and damage to axons of the ONH. Secondly, IOP fluctuations results in changes to the forces acting on the ONH vasculature, leading to changes in ONH vascular perfusion. These changes to perfusion could in turn result in relative ischemia of the ONH and consequent ONH damage.

The investigators propose to monitor diurnal fluctuations in IOP and choroidal blood flow (Pulsatile Ocular Blood Flow,POBF), and intervisit ONH topographical and blood flow changes-ie to monitor the direct ONH consequences of IOP . Open angle glaucoma patients are commonly prescribed topical latanoprost as first line therapy. The EXACCT study, for which I was the principal investigator and which is now submitted for publication, demonstrated that COSOPT was an efficacious choice as second line therapy for patients not controlled on latanoprost monotherapy. The investigators will therefore recruit 20 OAG patients on latanoprost monotherapy, perform diurnal curves of IOP, as well as a.m. ONH morphology and ONH blood flow. Cosopt will then be added and at the next visit the same measurements will be repeated.

The investigators expect that when Cosopt is added the investigators will demonstrate improved IOP, morphology and blood flow compared to the latanoprost baseline. Furthermore the investigators expect the the diurnal fluctuation of IOP and choroidal blood flow will be stabilized on Cosopt therapy. The implications are that adding Cosopt to latanoprost can stabilize not only the IOP but also the damaging consequences of IOP to the optic nerve head.","Twenty patients with open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension currently on latanoprost immunotherapy will be recruited.

A complete routine ophthalmic examination including biomicroscopy, gonioscopy and fundus ophthalmoscopy will be performed. The eye with better visual acuity is selected for fundus flowmetry.

All patients will undergo a complete diurnal workup including IOP, as well as 10am Confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg Retina Tomography-3) of ONH topography. Optic nerve head, nasal and temporal peripapillary retinal blood flow are measured with scanning laser Doppler flowmetry (SLDF; Heidelberg Retinal Flowmeter/Tomograph, SLDF analysis software v3.3, Heidelberg Engineering, Germany Goldmann IOP will be measured at 8am, 10am 2pm and 4pm. Pulse amplitude, similar to Pulsatility Ocular Blood Flow (POBF) will be measured using the Pascal Dynamic Contour Tonometer (DCT) at 8am, 10am, 2pm, and 4 pm.

All procedures will conform to the Declaration of Helsinki and the study will be approved by the Ethics Committee and each patient will sign an informed consent form.

Following visit one, Cosopt will be added to the patients therapy (bid). Following 6 weeks of therapy patients will return for visit two. Cosopt will be applied by the investigator at 8am on visit 2.

We expect that this blood flow will be improved with COSOPT therapy and that the diurnal fluctuation of this parameter will be improved as well.

The goal of the proposed research is to observe weather vitamin D supplementation can help the CGD children get through this challenge.,"Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is one of primary immunodeficiency diseases. Due to the deficiency of the phagocyte nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase the respiratory burst of all types of phagocytic cells is badly impaired which lead to a susceptibility to infection among CGD patients.

BCG vaccine is wildly used in China to avoid severe tuberculosis infection. Children are supposed to get BCG vaccine injected within 24 hours after birth. When patients with CGD got the vaccination of BCG they will easily got infected. And due to the immunodeficiency of these children, the infection cannot be cure by normal treatment.

Vitamin D supplementation was used to treat tuberculosis in the pre-antibiotic era and is reported to have influence on immune system especially on monocytes and macrophages thus may help CGD children defend the BCG infection. In addition, studies show that 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 can induce nitric oxide synthase thus may up regulate NO production and help host defense against human tuberculosis without the help of NADPH oxidase. Other researches indicate that Vitamin D and the expression of vitamin D receptor may lead to induction of antimicrobial peptide such as LL-37 which help macrophages kill the intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis. These discoveries indicated that vitamin D may induce immune response against BCG in a nontraditional way. Therefore, when CGD patients face BCG infection, add vitamin D supplementation to the treatment may help them survive this challenge.

COHORT A (ES-SCLC Personalized ultrahypofractionated stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (PULSAR) Thoracic Tumor):

Chemoimmunotherapy with 4-6 cycles of platinum/etoposide and PD-L1 (Programmed Death-Ligand 1 protein) inhibition has become the standard systemic therapy for extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), based on modest but significant OS (overall survival) benefits seen with the addition of either atezolizumab or durvalumab to chemotherapy in the IMpower133 and CASPIAN trials, respectively. However, outcomes remain poor with median OS of only 12.3 months. Notably, consolidative thoracic RT (radiotherapy) was not allowed either trial. This contrasts with prior signal for potential benefit for addition of thoracic RT to standard chemotherapy in ES-SCLC in the CREST trial, though this was not duplicated the RTOG 0937. Encouraging preliminary safety data has been published for addition of hypofractionated thoracic RT to single agent PD-1 inhibition after response to induction chemotherapy (6% grade 3 toxicity), but toxicities with doublet immune checkpoint blockade (ipilimumab/nivolumab) and RT showed a nearly 20% rate of high grade AEs (adverse events). This has led to an ongoing cooperative study (NRG LU007) seeking to define the impact of consolidative thoracic RT given with atezolizumab following induction chemotherapy. In the interim, while use of thoracic RT consolidation in ES-SCLC remains supported as a standard of care by guidelines, its implementation is variable. Particularly important open question involve timing for synergy/additivity with immune checkpoint blockade and cytotoxic therapy, minimization of target size for safety, and tailoring of dose according to patient need given significant competing risks for extra-thoracic progression and tolerance. In seeking to address this, this study notes that small cell lung cancer generally shrinks rapidly with each cycle of chemoimmunotherapy. Delivering a ""pulse"" of RT to the thoracic disease immediately prior to cycles 2-6 of chemoimmunotherapy may result in faster tumor response and reduction of overall treatment target size. Moreover, prolongation of time between doses enables observation of response, which would allow investigators to withhold further RT dose in those unlikely to benefit due to extra-thoracic progression or exceptional early response of thoracic disease.

COHORT B (Brain metastasis PULSAR):

Brain metastases from solid tumors affect nearly 30% of patients who die of cancer and present an increasing challenge for management as patients live longer with improved systemic therapies. Treatment often includes radiotherapy, increasingly delivered as stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) to spare normal brain. For larger lesions or those near sensitive areas, fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (FSRT) delivered in up to 5 treatments is used to reduce swelling and late injury. Prolongation of the duration between fSRT treatments from days to weeks further has enabled adjustments of the treatment target to tumor size changes over treatment, further reducing healthy brain exposure without sacrifice in tumor control (7). UT Southwestern has expanded upon this modified fSRT approach with PULSAR. Based upon observed kinetics of response, the predominant PULSAR approach has been to deliver treatments in two ""pulses"" given as 3 fractions every other day, 3-4 week break, and then 2 final fractions every other day. In the initial experience (n=109 treated lesions), PULSAR demonstrated favorable efficacy and tolerability in treating brain metastases (2-year 90% local control and \<10% grade 3 toxicity), when compared to historical fSRT reports especially for larger \>=2cm lesions. PULSAR for brain metastases thus shows high potential to address larger tumors and to individualize RT dose/intensity, especially in the setting of increasing numbers of central nervous system (CNS)-active systemic agents.

In particular, with longer patient survivals, there remains a critical need to reduce the risk of toxicity and edema by de-escalating dose in addition to target size. The best 'biomarker' for such de-escalation appears to be early radiographic response, with published work strongly correlating a \>=20% lesion volume reduction by 3-months to improved local control. Notably, such reductions are commonly seen in time for decision making in the PULSAR approach, with the collected data previously showing a median 38% reduction in larger tumors (\>=2cm) during treatment. Specifically, \~50% of patients achieve a 25% reduction by pulse 2. In this cohort, the study will assess whether a more conservative \>=25% tumor volume at interim imaging of PULSAR can be used to omit the second ""pulse"" for ""responders,"" while retaining high control rates.",University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,45.0,NON_RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,Cohort A: \>= 18 yo with extensive stage small cell lung cancer receiving standard chemoimmunotherapy and eligible for thoracic radiotherapy Cohort B: \>= 18 yo with solid tumor brain metastases (\<=5 total; size\>=2cm in brain or \>=1.5cm in brainstem) planned for fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (fSRT),TREATMENT,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Ischemic Conditioning (IC) is a non-invasive, simple procedure that improves motor function, exercise performance and cardiovascular function in healthy controls, but it has never been applied to the stroke population.

Future studies will examine the effects of IC and traditional therapy at different time points of recovery post stroke, durability of IC, molecular mechanisms of neural and cardiovascular adaptation and the efficacy compared with other adjuncts.","This study will quantify the effects of Ischemic Conditioning and treadmill training on improvements in: walking speed, leg strength, neuromuscular fatigability and the hyperemic blood flow response to muscle contractions, and vascular endothelial function and aerobic exercise capacity.

According to the operator's preference, EUS-FNA with suction or without suction technique has been used. To date, little is known about optimal number of to-and-fro motion during each needle pass. As usual 10-15 to-and-fro motions was used for EUS-FNA with suction technique. Theoretically, more number of to-and-fro motions may be required in EUS-FNA without suction. In this circumstance, the contamination of blood in specimen and possible adverse event may occur. To determine optimal number of to-and-fro motion in EUS-guided FNA for pancreatic masses in terms of with suction or without suction, this prospective single-blinded randomized trial was conducted.","For this prospective single-blinded randomized trial, two 10cc syringes was prepared. Two syringe was provided as same performance. However, one syringe is falsely made as suction syringe (fake one). During EUS-FNA, two syringe is randomly assigned and loaded by a nurse. Thus, operator was blinded which syringe is with suction or without suction.

First hypothesis: There is difference in the diagnostic accuracy of pancreatic masses according to EUS-FNA with suction or without suction/ different number of to-and-fro motion.

bd819cad71944c11,NCT03582397,Virtual Reality Mirror Therapy for Stroke,Virtual Reality Mirror Therapy for Upper Limb Rehabilitation Following Stroke,,AAAR5098,"Mirror box therapy is a treatment option that has shown promise for people with difficulty moving their arm after a brain injury, such as stroke. During mirror box therapy, people place their affected arm inside a box, where they are unable to see it. They then focus their attention on the outside of the box, which has been fitted with a mirror. The mirror reflects the movements of their intact hand and makes it appear that both hands are moving normally. Research has shown that this type of therapy can help people recover some use of the arm.

This study is designed to examine a new type of treatment, which uses a virtual reality headset (Oculus Rift) to recreate this effect in a virtual environment. Up to twenty people who have had a stroke and now have difficulty using an arm (Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity range 10-50) will be asked to come in for four weeks of treatment, during which they will perform a set of movements and games using the virtual reality platform, while focusing on the image of their affected arm. Treatment will include two fifteen minute sessions, three times/week for a period of four weeks. Participants will complete pre-testing, which will provide a baseline measure of performance, and post-testing, to see if the treatment has been well-tolerated and has had any impact on their motor performance.

This research is important because it may demonstrate the usefulness of a new treatment method for people who have suffered a stroke, or generally demonstrate that virtual reality platforms may be useful treatment tools for stroke survivors. It may also provide a relatively low-cost and motivating rehabilitation tool for use in the hospital or home environment outside of therapy hours.","Up to twenty stroke survivors with upper extremity impairment will be enrolled in this study. After subjects have been consented, they will undergo screening to ensure they meet inclusion/exclusion criteria. This will include the Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire (Short Form). Demographics will be recorded including: relevant medical history (including any contraindications to engage in virtual reality therapy), age, gender, hand dominance, and location and date of stroke. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment will be performed to assess feasibility of the intervention for subjects of varying cognitive levels. Subjects who meet study requirements and score between 10-50 points on the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery after Stroke (Arm/hand section) will complete pre-testing using the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT).

Virtual reality mirror therapy will be delivered via the commercially available Oculus Rift gaming system, using novel software (WiseMind), developed by Realiteer. Subjects will complete treatment in a designated space clear of distractions and physical objects. They will remain seated in a chair throughout treatment.

A member of the research team will configure the system, entering in the subject's skin tone, height, and weight to enable the system to best approximate their physical form. The subject will then don the Oculus Rift headset, which will block external visual stimuli and provide an immersive visual environment for training. Researchers will position game controller using a wrist strap to ensure patient safety. Researchers will orient subjects to the training environment and ensure patient comfort with the system before initiating treatment. Patients will complete a System Usability Scale and the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire on the first and final treatment day to assess system tolerance. Adherence and adverse events will also be recorded throughout the trial.

The WiseMind software will allow subjects to view an approximation of their upper limbs. As the subject moves their arms, the system will detect these movements and mimic them through the headset, so the patient envisions a virtual limb moving as their own. Training will incorporate range of motion exercises, virtual reality games that require reaching, and interacting with functional objects in the virtual environment.

An occupational therapist, physical therapist or exercise physiologist from the research team will run all treatment sessions. Training will be immediately terminated if the subject feels excessively queasy or requests termination for any reason. Training will consist of two, fifteen minute sessions, 3x/week for four weeks.

Gout causes very painful joint attacks that are first acute and then lead to chronic pain, and disabling deforming manifestations called tophus. The disease is strongly associated with cardiovascular comorbidities and chronic renal failure.

In New Caledonia, the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) (according to the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) \< 60 ml/min) was of 7.4% in 2015 (according to the epidemiological study ""Barometer Health 2015""). In the Loyalty Islands, which has overall significantly more Melanesian population, a local database showed that in 2018 the prevalence of patients having at least one blood test reporting kidney disease (GFR CKD\< 60 ml/min) and seen at least once in the previous two years was as follows:

* 7.7% in Lifou (9,200 inhabitants)
* 8.4% in Maré (5,700 inhabitants)
* 9.1% in Ouvéa (3,400 inhabitants) In summary, inflammatory diseases such as CKD and gout have high prevalence in New Caledonia and the Loyalty Islands, and constitute a major health issue. Although the high prevalence of these diseases is probably due in part to non-genetic factors (environment, diet, etc.), it is likely, given the demographic history of this region, that undetected genetic risk alleles among the Melanesian population contribute to the appearance and progression of diseases.

The use of many analgesic drugs, including opioids, is associated with adverse side effects, difficulties with rehabilitation, an increased risk of complications, prolonged hospitalisation, and the cost of the procedure. Cryoanalgesia as a part of multimodal analgesia along with the education and prehabilitation of the patient according to the novel original educational - training application 'Back on Feet' as well as the interdisciplinary care in accordance with the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol, which has a real impact on the optimisation of perioperative care.

This Before - After Study is a single institution pilot study designed to compare standard therapy (control group: regional analgesia: intrapleural or bilateral erector spine plane block) versus a novel approach (interventional group: Cryoanalgesia combined with bilateral single shot erector spine plane block) to address the need for better management of acute and long-term pain in the pediatric population diagnosed with funnel-chest and treated using the modyfied Nuss method.

First group received a standard care according to Polish guidelines. The data of control group analysed and the interdisciplinary team work protocol will be introduced to the interventional group. The interventional group was prepared according to prehabilitation with the 'Back on feet' application and perioperative ERAS protocols. The patients of interventional group received intraoperative cryoanalgesia using the Cryo-S Painless device (Metrum - Cryoflex Polska Limited) as an additional procedure to multimodal analgesia. This is the first time that the cryoanalgesia procedure was performed in children in Poland.

The aims of the study were the assessment the effectiveness of cryoanalgesia as a method of acute and long-term pain control, safety of the method and the impact of preoperative preparation according to the 'Back on Feet' program introduced as a part of ERAS protocol.

Specific Aim 1: To determine if, compared with current analgesia, the addition of cryoanalgesia decreases the incidence and severity of post-surgical pain.

Hypothesis 1a (primary): The severity of surgically-related pain was significantly decreased from postoperative day 2 with the addition of cryoanalgesia as compared with patients receiving solely standard-of-care treatment.

Hypothesis 1b: The incidence and severity of chronic pain was significantly decreased 3 months following surgery with the addition of cryoanalgesia as compared with patients receiving solely standard-of-care treatment.

Specific Aim 2: To determine if, compared with current analgesia, the addition of cryoanalgesia improves postoperative functioning.

Hypothesis 2a: Following modyfied Nuss procedure the range of motion and independence was significantly increased in the 2 postoperative day following operation with the addition of cryoanalgesia as compared with patients receiving solely standard-of-care treatment.

First-line antiviral drugs recommended by the Chinese 2015 Hepatitis B Guidelines include ETV and TDF. This study is based on a real-world clinical cohort to retrospectively analyze the effects of ETV and TDF on the long-term (5-year) incidence of HCC in Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis B with compensated cirrhosis. The results will guide the revision of the Chinese HBV guidelines.,"HBV infection is a global problem, and China has a heavy disease burden with approximately 86 million people infected with HBV. According to the epidemiological survey of nearly 230,000 people in Northeast China in 2010-2013, the positive rate of HBsAg reached 6.1%, of which 10.7% had cirrhosis.

According to the latest authoritative guidelines, including the guidelines published in 2018 by American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and in 2017 by European Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (EASL), entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir diisopropyl (TDF) are recommended as first-line antiviral drugs. ETV is a guanosine nucleoside analog that inhibits HBV polymerase and inhibits the synthesis of HBV DNA. TDF is a cyclic nucleoside phosphorylated diester structural analog of adenosine monophosphate, and its hydrolysis and phosphorylation products can inhibit the activity of HBV reverse transcriptase and also inhibit the synthesis of HBV DNA. In 2005, ETV was listed in China Mainland and TDF was listed in 2014. Over the years, clinical studies have shown that both have good antiviral effects and low drug resistance rates, so they are chosen as first-line antiviral drugs.

HBV infection is one of the risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previous studies based on the Chinese patients have shown that antiviral therapy (such as ETV) can significantly reduce the incidence of HCC in patients with cirrhosis (the 4-year cumulative incidence of HCC decreased from 17.5% to 9.4%). However, a study from South Korea published online in September 2018 in JAMA Oncology showed that TDF significantly reduced the incidence of HCC compared to ETV (HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.46-0.99) . In contrast, another multicenter study in Korea, published in March 2019 in The JOURNAL OF HEPATOLOGY showed no significant difference between ETV and TDF (HR 0.975, p=0.852) \[4\]. In the latter study, there was a problem with the small sample size, and the sample size was not sufficient to test the difference between the two antiviral drugs, and the sample size needed to be expanded to verify the result.

Compared with Koreans, the incidence of HCC in Chinese is significantly lower (in patients with cirrhosis, the 5-year cumulative incidence of HCC is about: China vs Korea: 12% vs 20%), showing the differences between countries. There is at present no similar study based on Chinese patients, especially in patients with cirrhosis to compare the effects of ETV and TDF on the incidence of HCC.

China has a huge disease burden and a high incidence of HCC. The ETV and TDF both have generic drugs marketing in China Mainland which through quality consistency evaluation and entering the 4+7 drug procurement (the centralized drug procurement in ""4+7 Cities"": Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing, Shenyang, Dalian, Xiamen, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chengdu and Xian), bringing good antiviral effect to patients at preferential prices. If we can detect the difference in the occurrence of HCC between ETV and TDF, rational selection of drugs will reduce the incidence of HCC in Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis B (Korean studies showed that cumulative HCC patients can reduce 32% in 5 years), greatly reducing the burden on Chinese patients and health care.

This research is a real-world, multi-center, retrospective, and observational study.

Patient data are collected from 5-10 research centers in mainland China, including basic demographic information, antiviral regimen, time of stating antivirus, endpoint event, time of endpoint event, last follow-up time, important testing data, etc.

Patients with the time of last follow-up (or the time of the endpoint event) between 2013-1-1 and 2019-12-31 are included in this study.

World Health Organization estimates that globally 30% of women have been subjected to either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence(IPV) or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime.

IPV refers to any behaviour within an intimate relationship that causes physical, psychological or sexual harm to those in the relationship. IPV definition covers violence by both current and former spouses and partners. Forms of intimate partner violence include: Acts of physical violence, sexual violence, emotional (psychological) abuse, and controlling behaviors.

Initial studies on IPV against women tended to concentrate on assessment of incidence and prevalence. Although prevalence is critical, reducing or eliminating some problems also requires comprehension of cultural norms and expectations.

An ecological approach showed that public attitudes accepting or justifying violence and aggression are a risk factor at a macro social level, as they can encourage or deter its occurrence in societies.

UN Women reported that among Egyptian women in reproductive age, the prevalence of lifetime physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence was 26% and the prevalence of physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence in the last 12 months was 14 %.

The Egyptian studies that assessed attitudes of acceptability of IPV and their predictors has explored acceptability to only one form of IPV.

It is by far the most common sustained arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice, with a striking impact on morbidity and mortality. Achieving a definite cure is highly desirable, as this would have profound social and economic implication. In patients with drug-refractory paroxysmal AF, multiple clinical trials have established the superiority of catheter ablation over further antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy for the long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm, to improve quality of life, and reduce hospitalizations. Recent randomized controlled trials have also demonstrated a beneficial role of catheter ablation as a first-line therapy in patients with paroxysmal AF, with significantly better arrhythmia control and improved quality of life compared to AAD therapy. Patients with symptomatic persistent AF represent a more challenging group to treat, given the overall lower success rate of catheter ablation procedures in this group of patients. Pharmacologic rhythm-control strategies are also less effective in persistent AF, with a substantially increased economic burden given the repeat admissions for electrical cardioversions and AAD initiation/titration. In patients with symptomatic persistent AF who have already failed AADs, catheter ablation has been shown superior to further AAD therapy for sinus rhythm restoration in a recent randomized controlled trial. However, the value of an upstream adoption of catheter ablation for the treatment of symptomatic persistent AF (i.e., before a trial with AADs) is unknown. The purpose of the third Radiofrequency Ablation vs Antiarrhythmic Drugs for Atrial Fibrillation Treatment (RAAFT-3) trial is to determine whether catheter ablation is superior to AAD as a first-line therapy in patients with persistent AF who had not been exposed to antiarrhythmic treatment.",University of Pennsylvania,OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,25.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,120 patients will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion (80 in the RFCA arm; 40 in the AADs arm),TREATMENT,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

These forms of maltreatment can lead to a large number of child developmental, emotional, and behavioral difficulties. As adults, children who are maltreated are more prone to unhealthy behaviors and conditions, such as drug and alcohol abuse, smoking, eating disorders, and depression. A previous study found that Project SafeCare, a treatment program that provides parent training to families with children who were at risk for or victims of maltreatment, resulted in fewer child welfare reports. Participants in Project SafeCare reported improvements in child healthcare, home safety, and parent-child relations. However, the study suggested that the SafeCare program may not be equally effective in decreasing the occurrence of all forms of child maltreatment, particularly child physical abuse. This study will determine the effectiveness of a complex evidence-based practice program, extending upon the SafeCare program, in reducing the occurrence of physical abuse and other forms of child maltreatment.

Participants in this study will receive services from Oklahoma Comprehensive Home-Based Services (CHBS), a program provided to families with issues of child abuse and neglect. Upon entry into the CHBS program, participants will undergo a computerized interview, lasting between 1 and 2 hours. The interview will include questions about family strengths and weaknesses, personal beliefs, substance abuse history, and opinion on CHBS. This computerized interview will be repeated at the end of treatment, approximately 6 to 12 months later. During the first few weeks of CHBS, an agent will make five visits to the homes of participants to observe pretreatment family life. Treatment services will concentrate on improving healthcare skills, parent-child interactions, and safety in homes and will specifically address ways to reduce physical abuse and other identified family issues.

It appears that stiffer arteries with a decreased elasticity increase the risk of stroke and heart disease. A novel way to know the stiffness of blood vessels is by a method called ""applanation tonometry"", which measures the ""pulse wave velocity"" of major blood vessels such as the aorta, carotid and femoral arteries. The purpose of our study is to determine if we can measure arterial stiffness reliably and accurately using this method in healthy people and in people with kidney failure receiving hemodialysis treatments at our centre. Also, we would like to know how stiff these arteries in healthy people are. If we demonstrate that the method is reliable and accurate in these 2 groups of participants at our centre, a future larger study is planned to determine if we can use measures of arterial stiffness to evaluate the risk of stroke and heart disease in people with kidney failure receiving hemodialysis. The research study will take place at the Ottawa Hospital-Riverside Campus.","Background:

Cardiovascular (CV) disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Arterial stiffness measured by pulse-wave velocity (PWV) has been identified as an independent predictor of fatal CV events in these patients. Our long-term goal is to study the impact of interventions that decrease progressive arterial stiffness on CV mortality in ESRD patients. Thus, we postulate that measurements of PWV during these interventions will predict CV outcome. Before studying this relationship, establishing the feasibility of PWV measurements at our centre is necessary.

Objectives:

i) To demonstrate the reliability and accuracy of arterial PWV measurements in healthy subjects and patients with ESRD at our centre, ii) To assess subject satisfaction and level of discomfort associated with the testing procedure, iii) To characterize normative values for the PWV in our two subject groups, and iv) To determine the feasibility of recruitment of patients with ESRD, as a pre-requisite for a larger trial focused on CV outcomes.

Methods:

PWV will be measured consecutively by 2 research assistants in: a) a group of 20 healthy subjects; and b) a group of 20 patients with ESRD on chronic hemodialysis at The Ottawa Hospital. Two consecutive sets of PWV measurements with a time-interval of 1 week (± 2 days) will be obtained in the healthy and ESRD groups (pre-hemodialysis, between 2 consecutive mid-week hemodialysis sessions). To determine the impact of hemodialysis on PWV measures, in a sub-group of 10 ESRD subjects measurements will be taken before and after hemodialysis. The order of testing by the 2 assistants will be randomized.",Ottawa Hospital Research Institute,OTHER,SPONSOR,OBSERVATIONAL,False,ACTUAL,36.0,,,,,CASE_CONTROL,PROSPECTIVE,,,,"HEALTHY SUBJECT GROUP

Studies in this field have highlighted the length and repetitiveness of these programs, which can lead to patient fatigue and pain. Combined with the lack of recreation and ecology in conventional therapies, which are often decontextualized and highly simplified, all these factors contribute to the lack of transposition of the improvements obtained into daily life activities (DLAs).

For several years now, the use of virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) have emerged as one of the most interesting solutions for overcoming these limitations. These technologies enable patients to take part in rehabilitation protocols under more controlled, progressive and attractive conditions, encouraging better patient adherence. These aspects guarantee effective rehabilitation and generalization of benefits to DLAs. In addition, they involve visuomotor coordination (skills involving the coordination of movements of different body segments with visual information previously perceived during execution), which is a cognitive ability widely transposable to DLAs.

Although some previous studies have investigated the effects of VR for motor rehabilitation, this technology also presents practical limitations related to the discomfort induced by the head-mounted displays (cybersickness, and physical discomforts caused by the weight of the display). Moreover, the use of VR tends to isolate the patient from their environment and therefore limits interaction with practitioners. Nevertheless, findings have shown the benefits of a VR protocol applied to motor rehabilitation in children and teenagers with cerebral palsy. The accuracy precision and fluidity of upper limb movements was improved, and the adherence to the protocol was strong.

In the line of these findings, the present protocol has several objectives: (1) to use MR, which seems to offer more possibilities while avoiding the disadvantages associated with VR, (2) to extend the applications of the proposed virtual rehabilitation tasks to other major motor functions - postural stability and locomotion as additional targets - and (3) to deploy these new rehabilitation methods to other patients likely to benefit from them (i.e. those with a functional disorder of neurological origin affecting their motor skills).

This study will include 120 patients with motor deficiencies of neurological origin, who will be randomly divided into two groups: one group receiving three weekly mixed reality rehabilitation sessions for four weeks, and a control group only following its usual care in the same period. Participants will be randomly matched for pathology, postural stability scores, age and sex.

To evaluate the evolution in time of the antiaggregant platelet effect of sertraline (SSRI) compared to placebo in depressive patients with ACS (Acute Coronary Syndrome) and treated as recommended by a double antiplatelet therapy, aspirin and clopidogrel.

Hypothesis:

The benefits of SSRIs observed in depressive patients with ACS are related to an antiplatelet effect.","Rational:

40% of patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) present depressive symptoms. The increase in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality at 6 months (hazard ratio = 3.5) could partly be explained by an alteration of the platelet parameters in patients with depression.

Sertraline is a potent inhibitor of the selective serotonin reuptake (SSRI). At the platelet level, it decreases the secretion induced by collagen and causes the inhibition of serotonin reuptake and platelet activation, wider than the simple anti-serotonergic effect. Its efficacy on depression of patients with ACS has been demonstrated (-20% of ischemic events at 24 weeks vs placebo), partly independent of the correction of depressive symptoms, and with a wide safety action. Antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory and endothelial function effects of sertraline are demonstrated in healthy volunteers, in stable patients and in patients with heart failure, but have never been explored in ACS .

Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial comparing SSRI and placebo in depressive patients with ACS.

A control (non depressive) ACS group will also do the clinical and laboratory follow-up at the same time (without drug administration), to constitute a reference for platelet parameters and to allow a comparison with the depressive ACS group treated with placebo.

The incidence rate of PTCL in China is much higher than the global average, and there is no unified standard treatment for initial PTCL. Currently, the CHOP regimen is widely used as first-line treatment. However, the overall response rate is still low, and effective therapies need to be explored. Epigenetics and genetics jointly determine critical features of tumors, and exploring new treatment strategies and developing targeted drugs based on deep understanding of the pathogenesis is of significant importance. The combined application of DNMT inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors has strong scientific support. The Phase II clinical study of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome in treating relapsed or refractory PTCL achieved positive results and regulatory approval. The CMOP regimen combining Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome with Chidamide is worth exploring for initial PTCL treatment.","Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) originates from mature thymic T-cells and is a highly heterogeneous and aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The 2016 revised WHO classification divides PTCL into 4 major categories with over 30 subtypes, including common subtypes such as anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL), ALK-positive/+ and ALK-negative/-, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), and PTCL, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) . In 2020, the estimated global incidence of new NHL patients was over 540,000, with over 90,000 cases in China. Compared with B-cell lymphomas, PTCL has a lower incidence rate, but PTCL patients' proportion in China is significantly higher than in Western countries at approximately 21% . The incidence rate of PTCL in China accounts for nearly 21% of NHL, much higher than the global average .

Currently, there is no unified standard treatment for initial PTCL. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines in the US and the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) recommend using the CHOP regimen (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) as first-line treatment . However, the CHOP regimen is mainly based on treatment experience with B-cell lymphomas, and more effective therapies need to be explored. Over the past few decades, research progress in both basic and clinical aspects of PTCL has been slow, with poor treatment outcomes. The overall response rate of first-line treatment is 50%-70%. Except for ALCL, ALK(+), PTCL patients receiving induction therapy are suggested to undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) treatment, yet even so, the overall response rate is still low, with a poor prognosis. Except for ALCL, ALK+ patients, the five-year overall survival (OS) rate of other subtypes is less than 50% , and PTCL patients are prone to relapse , with a three-year OS probability of about 20% .

The overall treatment effect for PTCL patients is still not ideal, and their prognosis has not improved over the past few decades. Patients often relapse early, with a shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and OS. Genetic mutations, variations, and tumor occurrence and development are closely related, and the same is true for epigenetic regulation. Epigenetics and genetics jointly determine critical features of a tumor: heterogeneity, plasticity, stem cell-like properties, and immune escape. As lymphomas often have epigenetic mutations, exploring new treatment strategies and developing targeted drugs based on a deep understanding of the pathogenesis is of significant importance in improving the efficacy of PTCL treatment.

Since both highly methylated DNA and low acetylated histones can lead to a closed chromatin state by independent mechanisms, resulting in the silencing of tumor suppressor genes , the combined application of DNMT inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors has strong scientific support. Both DNMT inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors have a chemosensitizing effect. Acetylation changes the chromatin structure, plays a role in regulating epigenetics as well as in chemotherapy sensitization, while DNMT inhibitors can enhance the sensitivity of lymphoma resistant to chemotherapy. Currently, the combination of AZA+HDACi in epigenetic treatments has been explored for lymphoma treatment.

In the Phase II clinical study of Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome, 108 patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL were treated with Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome alone, achieving an objective response rate (ORR) of 41.7% (32.3%, 51.5%) and a complete response rate (CRR) of 23.1% (25/108). The median PFS was 8.5 months, and the median OS was 22.8 months. The treatment was well-tolerated and efficacious, resulting in regulatory approval for Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome in treating relapsed or refractory PTCL adult patients . Based on this, the CMOP regimen, which is based on Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome combined with Chidamide, is worth exploring for initial PTCL treatment.",The First Affiliated Hospital with Nanjing Medical University,OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,30.0,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,,TREATMENT,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Patients with ICL are at risk for opportunistic infections typically associated with HIV/AIDS such as disseminated cryptococcal infection and severe human papillomavirus-related dysplasia. More than 20 years since the description of ICL, its etiology, pathogenesis, and management remain unclear. In this study we propose to administer the combination of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and plerixafor to ICL patients and healthy volunteers with the objective of harvesting mobilized CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) by apheresis for transfer into immunocompromised mice and for study with in vitro assays. The mice studies would serve to investigate thymic development, survival, and trafficking of the mobilized human cells within murine lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs.

HPCs are used for various therapies and there is an increasing use of agents that stimulate the bone marrow to produce progenitor cells and move them into the bloodstream where they may be harvested by apheresis. Not all patients respond to GCSF with vigorous HPC mobilization. The binding of chemokine receptor CXCR4 to stromal cell derived factor (SDF-1 or CXCL12) is an important interaction between a hematopoietic progenitor cell and its marrow environment. Plerixafor is a CXCR4 inhibitor which blocks binding to SDF-1 resulting in the release of hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34+) into peripheral circulation. In pharmacodynamic studies of plerixafor in conjunction with G-CSF compared to G-CSF and placebo, a two-fold increase in CD34+ cell count was observed.

Due to the important role CXCR4 plays in immune cell trafficking and its potential role in the pathogenesis of ICL, we propose as a secondary objective to assess peripheral CD4 T cell and CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cell numbers and functions in ICL patients compared to controls following G-CSF and plerixafor administration.

Study participants will be screened within 12 weeks prior to the study period. Eligible participants will receive G-CSF for 5 days with hospitalization on Day 4 for plerixafor injection followed by apheresis on Day 5.

It provides a new treatment method for stroke patients with hemiplegia that leads to lower limb function loss and activity disorder, and the therapy also has the advantages of simple operation, high safety, good patient compliance and low cost, which is worthy of further clinical research and promotion.","In this work, Stroke is a disease with a high incidence, high mortality and high disability rate, and it is becoming increasingly common in young individuals. More than 50% of these patients have long-term chronic motor dysfunction due to unilateral limb dysfunction, and abnormal limb movement patterns occur due to unilateral limb weakness, abnormal muscle tone and other symptoms, which can manifest as a typical ""hemiplegic gait"" on walking. Motor dysfunction after stroke, including muscle strength, dystonia and abnormal gait, is the main dysfunction, which can cause cardiopulmonary function decline, thrombosis, muscle atrophy, etc., reducing the ability of daily living and quality of life of patients. Routine rehabilitation training methods for stroke patients with dysfunction include muscle strength training techniques, neurodevelopmental treatment (NDT), motor relearning programs (MRPs), constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT), neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES).

About half of all middle-aged men who die by suicide are seen by a PCP within a month of dying, suggesting the value of primary care-based suicide prevention efforts, to complement strategies in other settings. Current impediments to primary care-based prevention are that many suicidal middle-aged men do not visit a PCP, and among those who do the topic of suicide is rarely broached, due to societal gender-linked norms (e.g., toughness); stigma; spurious concerns that talking about suicide increases risk; competing time demands; and lack of resources to cope with positive responses. PCP-targeted educational interventions have increased detection of suicidal men, but have inconsistently affected suicide behaviors, and still many suicidal men went undetected. Suicide behaviors are more likely to be reduced by evidence-based follow-up care - supportive follow-up contact and collaborative mental health care. However, such care can only be effective if at-risk men visit a PCP who identifies suicide risk and offers the care, and the men accept it. Thus, there is a pressing need to study the use of innovative tools like MAPS to activate at risk middle-aged men to signal their receptiveness to suicide discussion and care, prompting PCP inquiry and referrals to a form of follow-up care that is feasible for most practices to implement (e.g., TEBFC).","University of California, Davis",OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,93.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,TREATMENT,,,DOUBLE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Healthcare providers use this information to formulate a medical care plan that is aligned with these expectations. This shared-decision making process should occur with every medical decision, but it is especially important whenever decisions about end-of-life care are being considered. Eliciting patient preferences about resuscitation and life-support treatments in the event of life-threatening illnesses are considered to be a standard of excellent and appropriate medical care. Unfortunately, these discussions don't happen consistently and even when they do occur, are rarely ideal. The consequences can be devastating, often resulting in the delivery of unwanted medical care that can be associated with significant physical and mental suffering among patients and their families. In response to this problem, the investigators developed a novel tool to help guide these difficult conversations between healthcare providers and patients. The investigators previously tested this tool in a small group of hospitalized patients who found it acceptable and helpful.

The study targets two specific age groups-55-64 years (middle-aged) and 65-74 years (elderly)-to address the unmet need for effective TB prevention in populations with high disease prevalence and risk, particularly in countries with an aging population.

The trial involves three treatment arms:

Low-dose vaccine group: 2 μg ID93 + 5 μg GLA-SE High-dose vaccine group: 10 μg ID93 + 5 μg GLA-SE Placebo group: Normal saline (0.9%)

Participants will receive three intramuscular (IM) injections of their assigned treatment at baseline (Day 0), Day 28, and Day 56. They will be monitored for safety and immunogenicity over 12 months, with regular follow-up visits scheduled at 1, 6, and 12 months post-final injection.

Key Study Elements:

Eligibility Criteria: Participants must be BCG-vaccinated, HIV-negative, and have QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT) test results positive or negative. Chronic conditions are permissible if well-controlled. Women of childbearing potential and men must use approved contraception methods during the study.

Safety Monitoring: Adverse events (AEs) will be closely monitored, categorized as immediate AEs (within 30 minutes of vaccination), solicited local/systemic AEs (within 7 days), unsolicited AEs (up to 28 days), and serious AEs (SAEs) monitored until 12 months post-final dose.

Immunogenicity Assessments: Blood samples will be collected pre-vaccination and at multiple intervals (Day 28, 56, 84, and 392) to measure ID93-specific antibody titers (ELISA) and Th1 cytokine responses (ICS).

Sentinel Design for Older Adults: To ensure participant safety, a sentinel group design is employed for cohorts aged 65-74. Initial vaccination will proceed sequentially within smaller sentinel subgroups, with further cohort enrollment contingent on DSMB approval after reviewing safety data.

Study Objective:

This trial aims to establish the safety profile and preliminary immunogenicity of QTP101 as a step toward addressing the persistent global burden of TB, particularly in vulnerable older populations.

4b4779aeff27e6fc,NCT05509413,DEFLAGYN® Vaginal Gel and Spontaneous Remission and Regression of Unclear Cervical Smears and HPV High-risk Infections,DEFLAGYN® Vaginal Gel and Spontaneous Remission and Regression of Unclear Cervical Smears and HPV High-risk Infections,HPV-VG1,HPV-VG1,"Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are the most common sexually transmitted pathogens worldwide and in most cases are causally associated with the development of cervical cancer, one of the most common cancers in women and one of the leading causes of death in women worldwide. Precancerous lesions (dysplasias) or the presence of a high-risk HPV subtype are detected by a screening smear test performed by a gynecologist. If precancerous lesions are detected, conization (= surgical removal of a cone of tissue from the cervix) is the method of choice for removing the diseased tissue. However, if the degree of dysplasia is correspondingly low or the smear is unclear, then the guideline-compliant non-surgical treatment provides for a wait-and-see approach with PAP and HPV smear control after 6-8 months.

This ""wait-and-see"" approach can be complemented by local therapy with an immunostimulant. For this purpose, DEFLAGYN® (a vaginal gel containing silica and citric acid) and Aldara® (imiquimod, a Toll-Like Re-ceptor 7 antagonist) are available. However, while the latter is not approved for the treatment of cervical dysplasia or HPV infection, DEFLAGYN® has CE marking and approval as a medical device for treatment in a number of indications, such as unclear cervical smears, HPV-induced cervical lesions, p16/Ki-67-positive cervical lesions or cervical erosions.

However, available studies on the efficacy of DEFLAGYN are limited. For example, there is only one prospective randomized trial (Major et al, 2021, Arch. Gynecol. Obstet. 303:501-511), which included 216 women with histologically confirmed CIN 1/2. A 3-month intravaginal application of DEFLAGYN® resulted in regression of CIN 1/2 in 72% versus 25% in the control arm (no intervention). Side effects of therapy with DEFLAGYN® were not observed in this study.

Due to the frequency of CIN and HPV infections in the female population and due to the high medical relevance of a conservative method of treating this disease, further methodologically high-quality studies on the efficacy of DEFLAGYN® should be performed.","1. HPV and dysplasia of the cervix uteri Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are the most common sexually transmitted pathogens worldwide. The prevalence in both male and female populations is high. Epidemiological estimates suggest that 85-91% of sexually active adults acquire at least one genital HPV infection by age 50, with approximately 95% of HPV infections being spontaneously eliminated within 2 years in terms of HPV immunologic clearance. HPV preferentially infects the epithelial cells of the anogenital area and, through incorporation of HPV DNA into the host genome of the basal cells of the squamous epithelium of the cervix and subsequent expression of viral components, causes dysplastic changes in the cervical epithelium that, if left untreated, can develop into invasive carcinoma of the cervix (cervical carcinoma).

   Cervical carcinoma is the fourth most common cancer as well as the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide, responsible for 6.6% (570,000) of all new cancer cases and 7.5% (311,000) of cancer-related deaths in women in 2018.

   The precursor of squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix (approximately 80% of all cervical cancers) is cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), which has three grades of expression (CIN1, CIN 2, and CIN 3). Compared with invasive cervical carcinoma, the incidence and prevalence of precancerous lesions of the cervix uteri are much higher. It is estimated that approximately 100,00 w0omen in Germany develop high-grade dysplasia (CIN2/CIN3) each year.
2. Therapy Dysplasia of the cervix typically becomes conspicuous during gynecological screening examinations. Here, smears are taken from the ectocervix and endocervix and assessed cytologically for dysplastic cells and the quality of the smear after Papanicolaou staining. HPV infection diagnostics are also performed as part of the statutory cervical carcinoma screening (annually or every 3 years) in order to detect the presence of HPV high risk infections.

   In case of abnormalities in the cervical smear and/or HPV high risk infection with suspicion of cervical dysplasia, presentation to a specialized dysplasia consultation is recommended for further clarification of dysplastic changes. During the subsequent colposcopic examination, a histological tissue sample ('cervical biopsy') of conspicuous areas is taken. The histopathological processing of the tissue samples and the colposcopic image of the spread of the changes in the cervix then allow individualized therapy planning.
3. Conization as the standard of surgical treatment If precancerous lesions with the potential to develop into an invasive cervical tumor are detected, conization (= surgical removal of a cone of tissue from the cervix) is the method of choice for removing the diseased tissue. The worldwide standard surgical procedure for conization is LLETZ conization (=""Large Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone""). In addition to the risk of local persistence of precancerous lesions if cervical dysplasia is incompletely removed, LLETZ also increases the risk of preterm delivery in subsequent pregnancy. This risk increases with increasing volume of removed tissue. To reduce or avoid the aforementioned complications, conization should be performed under colposcopic vision and as little healthy cervical tissue as possible should be removed.
4. Non-surgical treatment options Non-surgical methods for the treatment of CIN and/or HPV high risk infections are limited. According to the current S3 guideline, in case of CIN 1 and/or HPV high risk infection, a wait-and-see approach with PAP and HPV smear control in 6-8 months is possible. Alternatively, local therapy with an immunostimulant may be used. DEFLAGYN® and Aldara® are available for this purpose. Aldara® is imiquimod, a Toll-Like Receptor 7 (TLR 7) antagonist, which leads to a local immune response. However, Aldara® is not approved for the treatment of CIN or HPV infections. DEFLAGYN®, on the other hand, has a CE mark and medical device approval for the treatment of unclear cervical smears (ASC-US, ASC-H, LSIL, HSIL or PAP II-p, PAP III-p, PAP IIID1, PAP IIID2 or PAP III, PAP IIID) or HPV-induced cervical lesions or p16/Ki-67-positive cervical lesions or cervical erosions.
5. DEFLAGYN® - Mode of action and approval status DEFLAGYN® is a vaginal gel containing silica and citric acid, which binds pathogens, inhibits their spread and exerts an antioxidant effect. It is applied intravaginally and used for 3 months. In a prospective randomized study of 216 women with histologically confirmed CIN 1/2, 3 months of intravaginal application of DEFLAGYN® resulted in regression of CIN 1/2 in 72% versus 25% in the control arm (no intervention). The rate of HPV high risk infections decreased from 87% to 44% in the intervention arm. No other intervention studies on the efficacy of DEFLAGYN® can be found in the literature (PubMed search on 08/14/2022; search terms: dysplasia, deflagyn, HPV, silicon dioxide gel, randomized).

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Can omitting chest wall RT after prosthetic reconstruction reduce the failure rate of breast reconstruction without significantly increasing the local recurrence rate?
* Does this approach ensure an improvement in the quality of life for patients without sacrificing therapeutic effectiveness?

Participants will:

* Be randomly assigned to one of two groups.
* One group will receive standard RT to the chest wall and supraclavicular and infraclavicular lymphatic drainage areas.
* The other group will have chest wall RT omitted and will only receive RT to the supraclavicular and infraclavicular lymphatic drainage areas.
* Participate in follow-up assessments to monitor reconstruction failure rates and local recurrence rates.

If there is a comparison group: Researchers will compare the outcomes of the two groups to evaluate the impact of chest wall RT omission on reconstruction failure and local recurrence risks.","Breast reconstruction, as part of the surgical treatment for breast cancer, offers an opportunity for patients who have undergone mastectomy to restore their body image and mental state, while post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) has advantages in local control and long-term survival of breast cancer. However, the integration of PMRT with reconstruction, especially using implants, raises concerns due to potential complications and the risk of reconstruction failure.

Reconstruction methods include autologous tissue and prosthetic implants, with the latter becoming more popular due to shorter surgery times and faster recovery. The choice between immediate, delayed, and two-stage reconstruction depends on tumor characteristics and patient factors. PMRT indications are based on tumor features and risks. The 2019 ESTRO expert consensus pointed out that the radiotherapy target area after breast prosthetic implantation should include the chest wall and all high-risk lymphatic drainage areas of the axillary region that have not been removed. While PMRT improves outcomes, it increases complications in implant-based reconstructions. Within two years after prosthetic reconstruction surgery, the proportion of patients who have at least one complication after radiotherapy is 39%, while it is 22% for patients who have not received radiotherapy. Early complications include fat or flap necrosis, thrombosis, infection, hematoma, delayed wound healing, and late complications include pain, prosthetic contracture, prosthetic exposure or rupture, and a decline in various indicators of aesthetic results. Patients who ultimately have to remove the implant or convert to autologous tissue reconstruction due to severe complications are defined as reconstruction failure. Among patients who received implant reconstruction and radiotherapy, the proportion of reconstruction failure after two years is the highest (18.7%); in contrast, the failure rate in the non-radiotherapy group or autologous reconstruction group is less than 5%.

Considering the high incidence of complications after prosthetic implantation, the failure rate of breast reconstruction may exceed 20%, while the local recurrence rate after breast reconstruction surgery is around 5%. For early-stage breast cancer patients undergoing cold knife one-step prosthetic reconstruction or two-step expander-prosthetic reconstruction, whether omitting chest wall radiotherapy can reduce the failure of reconstruction without significantly increasing the local recurrence rate, to ensure that improving the quality of life for patients does not sacrifice therapeutic effects. In response to this issue, this project proposes a ""randomized Phase II clinical trial of omitting chest wall radiotherapy after prosthetic reconstruction in early-stage breast cancer"" prospective study. This study will adopt a randomized controlled method, dividing patients into two groups, one group receiving routine chest wall plus supraclavicular and infraclavicular lymphatic drainage area radiotherapy, and the other group omitting chest wall radiotherapy and only receiving supraclavicular and infraclavicular lymphatic drainage area radiotherapy, aiming to evaluate the impact of omitting chest wall radiotherapy in PMRT after prosthetic reconstruction on the reconstruction failure rate of breast cancer patients, without significantly increasing the risk of local recurrence.","Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University",OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,152.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,TREATMENT,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Blood samples, fine needle aspirates, core biopsies, and bone marrow aspirates will be collected prior to and following vaccination to assess immune responses in the blood, lymph nodes, and bone marrow over multiple time points.","Ebolaviruses (EBOV), cause Ebola Virus Disease, a condition characterized primarily by hemorrhagic fevers with remarkably elevated mortality rates. The genus Ebolavirus encompasses five distinct viral species, namely Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV), Reston virus (RESTV), Sudan virus (SUDV), and Taï Forest virus (TAFV).

More than 20 human outbreaks have been reported world-wide since the identification of EBOV in the late 1970s. The most common geographical region affected by EBOV outbreaks is Central Africa, with two of the most notable outbreaks occurring in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of Congo in 1995, and Gulu, Uganda in 2000. Outside of Africa, EBOV infections have been reported in countries like Philippines, Italy, United Kingdom, United States of America, and others. Of particular significance is the 2014-2016 West African ZEBOV outbreak, which is known as the most extensively recorded outbreak to date with over 28,000 reported infections and a 40% approximated mortality rate. The outbreak significantly surpassed all preceding ZEBOV outbreaks in terms of geographical coverage, number of impacted individuals, and its disruptive influence on conventional societal activities.

Fatal ZEBOV infection is characterized by flu-like symptoms and high fever followed by multi-organ failure. While case-fatality rates vary between outbreaks and among the Ebola viruses, ZEBOV has been associated with up to 90% lethality. While specific treatment strategies including convalescent plasma, monoclonal antibodies, and/or direct- acting antiviral agents are being pursued, it is unlikely that treatment directed at the individual will be sufficient to control outbreaks. Hence, it is important to investigate prophylactic vaccines that confer protection against Ebola viruses in at-risk populations to prevent future outbreaks. Understanding the durability of these vaccines is of paramount importance.

The recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-based Ebola vaccine (rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP) was approved in 2019 as a single dose in the prevention against Ebola virus disease (EVD). Protection is primarily conferred by antibodies targeting the ZEBOV glycoprotein (GP), and ZEBOV-GP Immunoglobulin G (IgG) memory B cells (MBCs) can be detected in the blood 6 months following vaccination.

It is not fully understood, however, whether a single dose of rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP effectively generates germinal center (GC) responses that result in durable immunological memory.

The immune responses that ensue following vaccination consist of a series of highly orchestrated events in GCs of secondary lymphoid organs. The nature of these interactions ultimately dictates the quality and longevity of the immune response generated following vaccination. Long-lived bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) and MBCs are the end products of the GC reaction. Previous studies of human B cell immune responses to rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP vaccination have focused on the blood compartment. This strategy ignores the critical compartments of draining lymph nodes (dLNs), where GCs are formed, and bone marrow, the major reservoir of BMPCs.

Deuterium labeled water (D2O) or heavy water is chemically nearly the same as normal water (H2O) but the hydrogen atoms are of the heavy isotope deuterium (2H or D), in which the nucleus of the hydrogen atom contains a neutron in addition to the proton. Deuterium is not a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. When a person drinks D2O, it mixes with the body water, which is about 13 gallons in a 180 lb man. Many biological molecules use hydrogen atom from water as ""ingredients"" and will also use the deuterium from D2O if it is present in the body. Proteins, DNA, RNA, lipids, and other biomolecules become ""labeled""; the faster the biomolecules are being synthesized, the more they become labeled with deuterium. The deuterium labeled molecules can be measured by sampling blood and body fluids. After isolating the biomolecules /cells of interest, a sensitive form of mass spectrometry is used to determine the extent of deuterium incorporation. All biomolecules synthesized prior to exposure to heavy water would have hydrogen exclusively (natural levels of deuterium are in trace quantities), while biomolecules synthesized after drinking heavy water will have a mix of hydrogen and deuterium.

This study aims to directly examine the GC response induced in the dLNs after vaccination with rVSVΔG- ZEBOV-GP. The researchers will directly probe ZEBOV-GP-specific GC B cell responses and determine how long these GCs persist after a single vaccine dose. The researchers will determine the frequency of antigen-specific BMPCs that home to bone marrow after vaccination, and whether these BMPCs persist up to 1 year after a single dose. The researchers will determine the frequency of antigen-specific MBCs generated after vaccination. Across all compartments, the researchers will analyze the B cell receptor (BCR) clonal diversity and the degree of somatic hypermutation (SHM) induced by vaccination. This study will determine the degree to which a single dose of rVSVΔG-ZEBOV-GP generates durable GC responses and long lasting humoral immunological memory.

The researchers will use stable isotope labeling to trace antigen-specific B cell responses to vaccination. In one cohort, participants will consume D2O for 14 days post-vaccination, labeling cells proliferating within the first 5-6 weeks. Antigen-specific plasmablasts and early memory B cells, collected at peak frequencies on days 7 and 14, will incorporate high levels of deuterium, measured via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of DNA. Memory B cells and bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) will then be analyzed at later time points (Days 181 and 366) to assess deuterium dilution by newly divided cells. Another cohort, consuming D2O between days 57-85 post-vaccination, will label cells proliferating during the germinal center response. This approach enables the researchers to evaluate early versus later contributions to long-term memory B cells and antibody-secreting BMPCs.",Emory University,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,30.0,NON_RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,BASIC_SCIENCE,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

While on the lung transplantation waiting list, patient health, emotional wellbeing and quality of life can deteriorate. By improving or changing patient physical activity, healthy nutrition, tobacco cessation, patient preparation for lung transplantation can be optimized, risk of complications can be reduced, and outcomes post transplantation can be improved.

The potential of health coaching to improve health outcomes has been demonstrated in several chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, health coaching was proven effective through telemedicine.

No studies so far have addressed the potential effect of a pre-transplant health coaching program on existing medical conditions, transplant rates and post-transplant outcomes. Investigators hypothesized that health coaching can improve health outcomes and survival of lung transplantation candidates by supporting and growing patients' capacity to cope with the demands of their end stage pulmonary disease.","SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND Lung transplantation has become an established standard of care for selected patients with end stage pulmonary disease. Candidate selection begins with a referral from the non-transplant pulmonologist and if deemed suitable, begins an evaluation process that determines eligibility for transplantation. Candidates who meet all requirements are listed for transplantation. While on the waiting list, physical activity, healthy nutrition, tobacco cessation, and a few other health behaviors are essential to maintain candidacy. In addition to the physical limitations imposed by end-stage lung disease, transplant candidates face a range of psychosocial issues relating to changes in functional capacity, including social roles, relationships, perceptions of self, and life plans and goals. Efforts targeted at these domains may improve quality of life, optimize patient preparation for transplantation, reduce the risk of complications, and improve outcomes.

Health coaching has emerged as a widely adopted intervention that may help individuals with chronic conditions adopting health behaviors that improve quality of life, health, and emotional wellbeing. It is a patient-centered approach wherein the individual and coach work together through active health education processes and motivational interviewing to set goals that improve health outcomes. The potential of health coaching to improve health outcomes has been demonstrated in several chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, health coaching was proven effective through telemedicine; and recently, it has developed national standards and accreditations in the US. Therefore, health coaching was selected as our telemedicine approach, and a novel health coaching telemedicine program (HCTP) was developed at Sheba Medical Center for lung transplantation candidate.

No studies so far have addressed the potential effect of pre-transplant health coaching program on existing medical conditions, transplant rates and post-transplant outcomes. Investigators hypothesized that health coaching can improve health outcomes and survival of lung transplantation candidates by supporting and growing patients' capacity to cope with the demands of their end stage pulmonary disease.

SPECIFIC AIMS Specific Aim 1: To assess whether HCTP is feasible among participants with end stage lung disease who are candidate for lung transplantation.

Specific Aim 2: To collect data on the impact of a HCTP on health-related quality of life, lung functions, functional capacity, cardiometabolic parameters (e.g., weight, lipid profile, fasting glucose), and hospital services utilization of participants with end stage lung disease who are candidate for lung transplantation Specific Aim 3: To collect data on experience and capacity to cope with the demands of the illness of participants with end stage lung disease who are candidate for lung transplantation.

STUDY DESIGN Detailed Plan of the Study The health coaching tele-medicine program study is a randomized controlled feasibility trial in which study participants are randomly assigned into either a study group or a control group.

Source of participants and recruitment methods: This study is a collaboration between the lung transplant program and the center of lifestyle medicine, within Sheba's cardiometabolic prevention center, a unique center in Israeli health care services that promote innovative lifestyle interventions. Our target population is 56 adults with end stage lung disease who refer to The Sheba Medical Center lung transplantation program for evaluation; over a period of 12 months.

METHODS:

This study is expected to be ongoing for 24 months but conducted for each subject in a 12-month timeframe. Data collection time points every quarter for 12 months.

Assessment include:

* Health related quality of life (HRQL)
* Lung functions tests
* Hospital services usage: will be evaluate using the hospital medical record. These services include health professional services in the rehabilitation hospital.
* Health behaviors: Nutritional intake will be evaluated by a 4-day food record.
* Physical activity questionnaire.
* Cardiometabolic outcomes
* Qualitative data: Investigators also expect to deepen our understanding about participants' experience in the program and their capacity to cope with the demands of their illness through the study's qualitative component. Qualitative data will be included in analyses for both participants who completed the intervention and participants who dropout.

Information regarding demographics, medications, other health behaviors (e.g., smoking status, physical activity status), and use of other nutritional education resources during the program (e.g., dietitian and physician visits, apps) will be extracted from the medical record.

PROCEDURE INTERVENTION: Both the intervention and control groups will receive the standard care for lung transplantation candidates. In addition for:

Study group participants - study group participants will complete a HCTP program which includes 12 weekly one-on-one 30-minute tele-sessions through Zoom, delivered by a credential health coach (health care professional who also completed a health coaching certification). Prior to the beginning of the program participant will complete intake assessment that will include past and current medical history, medications, current lifestyle practices, self-reported health status, psychosocial status, and other relevant information. At the first session, participants identify their health vision and 3-month health goals. During each subsequent meeting, participants will review their progress towards reaching the prior week's goals and identify goals for the coming week, using a self-discovery process facilitated by the health coach. Based on the initial assessment individualized action plan will be formulated to help each participant achieve his/her goals. The action plan will focus on important lifestyle practices (especially physical activity/exercise training, correct nutrition, weight management, tobacco cessation, and stress management. Based on their interaction with the participant and/or input from the participant's physician or other health care providers, health coaches will revise goals and action plans. When patients detect the need for health care advice that is necessary for their progress, s/he will be referred to health care professionals in the rehabilitation hospital that provide care for lung transplantation candidate.

2\. Control group: Control group participants will receive HCTP after the end of the study.

Statistical methods: Patients will be randomized 1:1 between the 2 study arms. Investigators will use block randomization stratified by site. Power calculation indicates that 28 participants (14/ group) are required in each of the intervention groups in order to estimate a retention rate of 80% with 10% precision and 80% confidence. Every effort will be made to minimize dropouts, and further to follow-up with participants who do not complete the program to obtain measurements of study outcomes. In the event of missing data, the impact will be assessed and addressed, if necessary, according to current best practices. Demographic and other baseline characteristics as well as feasibility outcomes will be summarized using means and standard deviations for normally distributed variables, medians and interquartile ranges for non-normally distributed variables, and frequencies for count or dichotomous variables.

20 patients with COPD and chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure will spent two nights on NIV, one with spontaneous timed pressure controlled bilevel ventilation (BiPAP-ST) and one with the advanced mode of intelligent volume assured pressure support (iVAPS). Patients will spend the treatment nights in randomized order under polysomnographic surveillance, including transcutaneous PCO2 measurement. Besides the number of arousals and PCO2 values over night the sleep quality will be judged with regards to especially adjusted respiratory event criteria like unintentional leaks, patient ventilator asynchrony, and decrease of ventilatory drive.","Non invasive ventilation (NIV) is one of the major medical innovations of the last 30 years. Especially continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the established Gold Standard in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) treatment.

NIV with bilevel ventilation (BiPAP-ST) is the established Gold Standard in acute hypercapnic respiratory failure, especially in exacerbated COPD.

Still, the adaption of CPAP in OSA is less complicated than a bilevel therapy in hypercapnic failure. The adjustment of NIV requires not only the definition of expiration pressure (PEEP) but also of inspiration pressure support. Only adequate pressure difference guarantees effective ventilatory assistance and an improvement of alveolar ventilation. The pressure changes need to be defined by the physician, as well as the breathing frequency.

Ventilation can furthermore be controlled by a target volume (volume controlled) or a target pressure (pressure controlled).

Moreover, patients with respiratory insufficiency are often suffering of significant dyspnoea and are hard to accustom to a respiratory mask.

a5ee968daa65c113,NCT05214313,Impact of a Standardized Music Therapy Protocol on the Quality of Life of Patients With Abnormal Movements Treated With Continuous Electrical Neuromodulation,Impact of a Standardized Music Therapy Protocol on the Quality of Life of Patients With Abnormal Movements Treated With Continuous Electrical Neuromodulation (Music-QOL),Music-QOL,RECHMPL20_0672,"The study of the impact of music on emotional, motor and cognitive aspects remains recent. Music therapy has experienced a major boom over the last half century thanks to neuroradiological techniques for investigating the brain, and in particular in vivo functional MRI. Brain imaging has also made it possible to highlight and analyse certain activations of the networks concerned during the passive listening of music (receptive music therapy) but also during the playing of a musical instrument and/or the use of the voice (active music therapy). The accumulated data in music neurophysiology is now considerable \[1\]. Music therapy has thus been associated with motor rehabilitation in the case of acquired (stroke) and/or degenerative (Parkinson's disease) pathologies and has also been proposed as a means of pain relief. However, although proposed in the middle of the 20th century as a potentially therapeutic tool, music therapy has not managed to prove sufficiently effective to be validated in medicine. One of the limitations remains the intervention of numerous subjective factors, notably in the establishment of ""protocols"" and the absence of standardisation in their very structures.

Each year, the ""Resistant Brain Pathology"" unit of the Department of Neurosurgery takes care of more than a hundred patients who have benefited from treatment with Continuous Electrical Neuromodulation (CEN) in order to respond to a motor symptomatology that is resistant to the usual treatments. The benefits of DBS in the management of abnormal movements have been demonstrated \[2\]. However, this symptomatic treatment does not exclude a worsening of the underlying pathology over time, thereby increasing latent anxiety and promoting the fragility of otherwise severely disabled patients. The management of chronic diseases requires the expertise of a multidisciplinary team so that each aspect contributing to the quality of life of patients can be assessed and supported as best as possible.

In order to improve the quality of life of our patients, a music therapy unit has been established within the multidisciplinary neurosurgery department for two years now. The clinical music therapist attached to the unit has a dedicated room, offering a sensory environment conducive to relaxation and including all the necessary comfort. A standardised protocol for the conduct of the sessions, the organisation and choice of music in direct relation to the different emotions explored on the basis of the permanent perception of heartbeats was developed on the basis of the Webb \& all study \[3\]. When a patient is immersed in a sound bath, identical to that perceived in utero, it would seem that this potentiates the benefits expected from music therapy sessions \[3\].

Our approach, although empirical, shows a decrease in anxiety and an increase in well-being in about fifty patients. Our observations support those highlighted in the literature in other pathologies \[4\] and encourage the use of this approach as a preamble to more specific explorations, in particular the catalysis of certain motor behaviours.

This project is therefore in line with this approach and continuity.

The investigators thus hypothesize that participation in a standardized music therapy protocol (active, receptive and psychomusical relaxation) against a background of regular heartbeats improves the quality of life of the operated patients by acting in particular on a reduction of anxiety and depressive symptoms.

To our knowledge, music therapy has never been proposed in a standardised way to patients with multiple disabilities, operated on and cared for over the long term in a functional neurosurgery department. This approach remains non-invasive and attractive in an often anxiety-provoking hospital context.","Methodology:

This is a prospective, controlled, randomised, open-label, single-centre, two-arm, parallel, 1:1 ratio, non-drug therapeutic interventional study with three months of follow-up (Category 2)

The analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints will be conducted on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis: each patient will be analysed in his or her randomisation arm once the patient has been assessed at inclusion and has received at least one assessment of the primary endpoint.

Initial comparability of groups A description of each group will be made by giving the frequencies of the different categories for the qualitative variables. As the distributions of the quantitative variables are not always Gaussian, the description of these variables will be done using the mean and the standard deviation but also the median and the minimum and maximum values. In case of non-comparability of the groups on one of the confounding factors, an adjustment or a stratification (in case of interaction) will be considered.

Analysis of primary endpoint The absolute change in the SF36 total score between the 2 assessments (T0 and T3 months) will be compared between the two groups using a Student's t test if the distribution is Gaussian or by a non-parametric test otherwise (Mann-Witney).

To estimate the ""effect size"", the variation of the score will be analysed by an analysis of covariance model including the intervention effect (ETP) and the SF36 inclusion value. In case of a non-Gaussian distribution, a transformation for normalisation will be applied and the normality of the residuals will be tested.

Analysis of secondary endpoints Changes in the SF36 score, SF36 subscores, anxiety and depression symptom scores and EVIBE will be analysed using the same methods as the primary endpoint.

Changes in knowledge of the disease will be analysed for each domain (Chi-2 test or Fisher's exact test) in intergroup and intragroup (Mac-Nemar's chi2) at 1 and 3 months.

Depending on the nominal, ordinal or continuous nature of the other clinical and socio-demographic variables, the analysis is carried out using Pearson's, Spearman's or Kendall's correlation coefficients, using a Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, or using parametric (Student's or ANOVA) or non-parametric (Mann Whitney's and Kruskall Wallis' test) tests of comparison of means.

The alpha risk will be set at 5% for all tests. The statistical analysis will be carried out at the clinical research unit of the Department of Medical Information of the Montpellier CHRU with SAS version 9 software (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.).

Number of patients:

The calculation of the number of subjects was carried out in collaboration with the Clinical and Epidemiological Research Unit of the University Hospital of Montpellier.

Based on the study \[5\] available in this field and using the SF36, the investigators hypothesise that the difference in variation of the total quality of life score (primary endpoint) to be highlighted between the 2 groups would be of the order of 10 points, with a standard deviation of 13. With a power of 80% and a first order risk of 5%, 27 subjects per group would be required. Anticipating a 10% drop-out rate, the number of patients to be recruited is 30 subjects in each arm, or 60 subjects in total.

Patient selection:

The patients likely to be included in the study are adults, followed in the functional neurosurgery department, associated with the ""resistant brain pathology"" unit, operated, treated by Continuous Electrical Neuromodulation, and medically stabilized.

Duration of project:

Duration of the inclusion period: 24 months Duration of participation of each participant: 3 months Duration of statistical analysis and final report writing: 7 months Expected duration of the study: 34 months

Schedule visit:

During a follow-up hospitalisation in the unit, patients will be systematically informed about the music therapy protocol. If the patients meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate in our research, after signing the consent form with the study doctor, the patients will be called for an inclusion visit (V0). During this V0 visit, the patients will be received by the music therapist in order to carry out a psychomusical assessment of about 1 hour, then by the neuropsychologist to submit them to the various evaluations mentioned below.

Patients will then be randomised to one of two groups : ""intervention"" group or ""control"" group.

The music therapy programme will consist of 14 sessions spread over three months, with two weekly sessions in the first month, a single weekly session in the following month and two monthly sessions in the last month. Given the pilot nature of our study, the investigators will carry out an evaluation at 1 month (V1) in order to observe the impact of the protocol proposed intensively in the first month. A final evaluation will be proposed by the neuropsychologist at the end of the study. This will be coupled with a routine medical visit in the unit (V2).","University Hospital, Montpellier",OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,21.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,SUPPORTIVE_CARE,,,SINGLE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Also, the investigators will assess voice impairment by using perceptual examination tools. Then, the investigators will apply spectral analysis to assess the main frequency components of voice in healthy participants and in patients affected by neurologic disorders with a prominent voice impairment. To distinguish between healthy participants and patients affected by various neurologic diseases, the investigators will apply a voice analysis based on support vector machine (SVM) classifier that included a large number of features in addition to the main frequency components of voice.

For these purposes, the investigators will assess in detail the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value and accuracy of all diagnostic tests. Furthermore, the investigators will calculate the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to verify the optimal diagnostic threshold as reflected by the associated criterion (Ass. Crit.) and Youden Index (YI). To assess possible clinical-instrumental correlations, the investigators will also use a modified algorithm of SVM analysis to calculate a continuous numerical value (the likelihood ratio \[LR\]) providing a measure of voice impairment severity for each participant.

Voice recordings will be performed by asking participants to produce a specific speech task with their usual voice intensity, pitch, and quality. The speech task will consist of a sustained emission of a close mid-front unrounded vowel /e/ for at least 5 seconds.

ea73a70433bb5fd9,NCT01366560,Effect of GSK962040 on Oesophageal Function,A Double Blind Randomised Placebo Controlled Two Way Cross Over Study to Determine the Effect of GSK962040 on Oesophageal Function and Gastric Emptying in Healthy Male Volunteers.,,114639,"GSK962040 is a selective non-peptide motilin receptor agonist which is in development for the treatment of conditions associated with slow rates of gastric emptying. Single ascending doses (1 to 150 mg), and 14-days repeated doses (10 to 125 mg daily) have been investigated in two randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Results show that these doses were well tolerated with few mild to moderate adverse events (AE), and no clinically significant abnormal vital sign measurements, ECG changes or abnormal clinical laboratory findings. GSK962040 exhibited predictable PK with and without food. The mean within subject time for half a \[13C\]-containing meal to empty from the stomach (GE t½) decreased by 22-43% from placebo with GSK962040 50-150 mg single doses, and shortening of gastric emptying was confirmed at doses of 50 mg and above in the repeat dose study.

Several studies have shown that motilin agonists increase lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) pressure and have various dose dependent effects on oesophageal peristaltic amplitudes and propulsive contractions in both healthy volunteers and patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). The purpose of the present study is to examine the effect of GSK962040 on oesophageal function, using techniques such as high resolution oesophageal manometry, and pH/gastric transit using a wireless motility capsule.","Motilin is a peptide found in specific endocrine cells in the epithelia of the upper small intestine . It is released during fasting to act at its own receptor (motilin receptor, previously known as GPR38) resulting in the initiation of Phase III of the migrating motor complex (MMC). MMCs begin in the upper regions of the gut and are usually characterized by three distinct phases (I, a period of near-quiescence; II, short- or non-propulsive contractions at irregular frequency; III, a final burst of high amplitude propulsive contractions), terminating within the distal regions of the small intestine. Phase III activity may help clear the stomach and intestine from any undigested material, prevent bacterial overgrowth in the upper gut and perhaps help develop the sensation of hunger. The association of motilin release with Phase III of the MMC, together with an ability of motilin to mimic the strong propulsive contractions which comprise Phase III, has argued for an involvement of motilin in the regulation of certain functions of the gut during fasting.

Motilin receptor agonists can increase gastric emptying after ingestion of a meal; this action is mediated via the cholinergic system of the stomach. Erythromycin and motilides (non-peptide derivatives of macrolide antibiotics but devoid of antibiotic activity) are motilin receptor agonists and effective gastroprokinetic agents in patients. Erythromycin has been shown to stimulate gastric emptying in patients with diabetic, idiopathic and post-vagotomy gastroparesis, and in critically-ill patients receiving enteral nutrition, EM574 and KC 11458, and the peptide motilin receptor agonist atilmotin, also increase gastric emptying in humans.

In addition to effects on gastric emptying, motilin also appears to produce an effect on the oesophageal musculature. In particular, several studies have shown that single doses of motilin agonists (erythromycin in healthy volunteers and in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), atilmotin, a peptide motilin agonist, in healthy volunteers) , increase lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) pressure and have various dose dependent effects on oesophageal peristaltic amplitudes and propulsive contractions in both healthy volunteers and patients with GORD. In addition, there is evidence that reduction of GORD in patients by using a motilin agonist may be useful clinically. For example, in a recent study in patients following lung transplantation, it was demonstrated that azithromycin, a motilin agonist macrolide antibiotic, reduced the number of reflux events and total oesophageal acid exposure as well as reduce the proximal extent to which reflux was regurgitated.

The clinical trials of promotility agents in GORD have not, however, shown consistent benefit. This may be related to compound characteristics. The dynamics of the relationship between PK and the effect on oesophageal function may be a factor as the most consistent data supporting their role as prokinetics in GORD come from studies which administered the drug intravenously, a route of administration which would not be suitable for a broader GORD population. In addition, if high doses of macrolides are required to have an effect on GORD, there is a risk of overlapping with antibiotic therapeutic doses, which would limit the interest of such approach. Macrolides also induce side effects such as nausea and abdominal, which makes macrolides difficult to tolerate for many patients. Another factor to consider is that repeat administration of macrolides induces desensitization of the motilin receptor reducing their efficacy over time, a phenomenon called tachyphylaxis. A strategy to decrease the tachyphylaxis to stimulation of motilin receptors is to identify agents that do not possess a complex motilide structure like erythromycin. This was the approach taken by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) by which they identified GSK962040, a small molecule motilin receptor agonist, which is not a motilide.

GSK962040 was designed using the recombinant human motilin receptor to enhance the specificity for the receptor and potentially decrease the negative characteristics encountered with compounds with complex and non-specific motilide structures. A range of in vitro and in vivo studies have been conducted using GSK962040 to investigate its primary, secondary and safety pharmacology and toxicology. In addition, the pharmacokinetics (PK), absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination of GSK962040 have been investigated in non-clinical species through a series of oral and intravenous studies.

The First Time in Human (FTIH) study (MOT107043) of GSK962040 is completed. It was an ascending single dose, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, with doses in the range of 1-150 mg to assess safety and tolerability, PK and pharmacodynamic effects on gastric emptying (GE) in healthy male and female volunteers. Dosing with GSK962040 was well tolerated. The results demonstrated that GSK962040 has an approximate dose proportional PK profile. Single doses of GSK962040 in the range of 1 to 150 mg resulted in mean exposures less than 23 μg.h/mL (AUC). At single doses of 50 mg to 150 mg, the rate of GE measured by the 13C-octanoic acid breath test was significantly increased in healthy volunteers when compared with placebo. Increasing the dose above 50 mg did not result in a greater effect on GE. The mean within subject time for half a \[13C\]-containing meal to empty from the stomach (GE t½) decreased by 22-43% from placebo with GSK962040 50, 75, 125 and 150 mg single doses (p ≤ 0.02). Increases in the rate of gastric emptying occurred in 85% to 100% of those healthy subjects receiving the 50 to 150 mg doses. The 14-day repeat dose study in healthy volunteers (MOT109681) was an ascending dose, randomised, placebo-controlled trial over the range of 10 mg to 125 mg daily. GSK962040 was well tolerated over the 14- day administration period for the doses tested and exhibited predictable PK, with and without food. The results indicated that GE was enhanced at doses of 50 mg and above, throughout the 14-day dosing. GSK962040 is currently in Phase II clinical development, being investigated in intensive care patients who receive enteral feeding, and in patients with diabetic gastroparesis. The present study will investigate effect of GSK962040 on oesophageal function because a combination of enhanced GE, barrier function (i.e. increase in LOS pressure) and oesophageal clearance would be potentially beneficial in patients with GORD or regurgitation.

Non clinical and clinical data indicate that a motilin agonist such as GSK962040 may also influence oesophageal function as well as GE. The purpose of the present study is primarily to evaluate the physiological effect of clinical doses of GSK962040 on oesophageal function in healthy volunteers, using established methods (oesophageal manometry, ambulatory pH/Impedance monitoring). GE will also be measured, using wireless motility capsule (WMC) monitoring. Given this is a physiological assessment, the use of healthy volunteers is considered appropriate; in addition, the study population will comprise male volunteers only in order to reduce variability in the measurements and therefore sample size, as GE varies with gender. The information from this study will inform decision making as to whether GSK962040 could have utility in conditions in which lower oesophageal function is deranged such as GORD.",GlaxoSmithKline,INDUSTRY,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,14.0,RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,,TREATMENT,,,DOUBLE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

The infection is aggressive with high pathogenicity. Global confinement impacts all social and economic fields of human activity. Clinical behavior exceeds the capabilities of public health care. With the initial information on the pandemic, it is estimated that 20% of health personnel in direct contact with patients can acquire the disease, despite preventive self-care. The molecular relationship of COVID-19 with the subject's ACE2 protein encourages the virus to enter the host cell, and initiates replication and the immune response, causing an imbalance generating an immunological storm of cytokines, with serious damage to the host.

Objective: It is proposed to supply a combined scheme of two compounds by oropharyngeal spray that captures the virus before entering the target cell and orally administer immunomodulatory compounds that regulate the inflammatory response released by the virus, in order to improve the antiviral response.

Methodology: A controlled, parallel design, triple-blind, phase II clinical trial will be conducted with two study groups to compare the active compounds (oropharyngeal spray and emulsion) with placebo.

Discussion: With the application of the combined scheme of two compounds, a 75% reduction in infection is expected for workers in direct contact with COVID patients.","RESEARCH QUESTION: Can the oropharyngeal spray of a viral blocking compound in conjunction with the provision of an immunostimulant emulsion, reduce the infection proportion by 2/3

ACTIVE PRINCIPLE Intervention 1. BlockACE2® spray, antimicrobial and antiviral liquid solution for mouth spray, composed of 3 natural bioactive substances proven to be used in humans, which present molecular structures homologous to the native receptor of the virus. It contains binding peptides that resemble the ACE2 receptor, which bind to viral fractions, and acts as soluble scavengers of the virus at the entrance gate, upper respiratory tract, or oropharyngeal region, preventing its entry into the target cell and decreasing the amount of virus that enters the body; consequently, they reduce their ability to generate damage.

BlockACE2® Defense, food for oral administration in the form of an emulsion with 8 bioactive components that have shown modulation of the inflammatory response. Contains natural oils, Vitamin B6, Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Vitamin D3 100 SD / S, and minerals; key micronutrients that are not normally obtained through a traditional diet. These nutrients are immunostimulants with proven capacity to enhance the cellular response against viruses, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and chemoprotective activity, stimulating the production of interferon I; and as a whole, they prevent the generation of an excessive immune activation process, known as an ""immune storm"" mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Intervention 2, Placebo:

Preparations without active components in the pharmaceutical form of the above (Intervention 1 and Intervention 2). They will be presented with the same physical characteristics such as size, shape, color, taste, smell, consistency, printed signs, weight, surface finish, internal and external; in order to guarantee the principle of masking.

RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS:

In a population with community risk of COVID-19 infection, the combined use of the study interventions (the oral antimicrobial solution in Spray BlockACE2® and the food in BlockACE2® emulsion, compared to the use of Placebo, reduces the risk of COVID-19 infection expressed in a negative PCR result in those who seroconvert to IgM, and in those who seroconvert, the higher proportion will be in the mild-moderate clinical form.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To establish the efficacy of the combined use of BlockACE2® oropharyngeal spray, and BlockACE2® emulsion, in comparison with placebo on the reduction of the risk of infection by COVID-19, expressed in the negative result of immunoglobulins for COVID-19 (30 days from admission to the project).

Establish the safety of the products under study by evaluating the expected and unexpected adverse events that are recorded during the use phase of the intervention scheme (30 days from project entry).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE To establish the efficacy of the combined use of BlockACE2® spray, a soluble virus scavenger compound plus ingestion of BlockACE2® emulsion, a compound that improves the defenses of the immune system, compared to placebo, on reducing the risk of infection by COVID-19 expressed in the clinical response of the disease that is defined in three variables, mild to moderate: onset of fever, myalgia, and cough without dyspnea; severe: fever, myalgia, cough and dyspnea requiring hospital care; and critical: all the above plus ventilatory assistance in ICU.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES Explore the efficacy of the combined use of BlockACE2® spray, a soluble virus scavenger compound, plus the intake of BlockACE2®, an emulsion food with key micronutrients that stimulate the antiviral cellular immune response on reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection expressed in the negative result of IgG, IgM; and the reduction of the risk of symptoms such as fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, or ventilatory assistance in the ICU after 15 days of finishing the scheme.

FIELD OF STUDY: Workers of every department of Conconcreto Company in the city of Medellín and Girardota

INTERVENTIONS:

Intervention 1 BLOCKACE2: Two oropharyngeal sprays of the compound, every 4 hours, during the day. For the BlockACE2 emulsion will be used 20 ml during the first 5 days and after it only 10ml every day for 30 days. Dosing of the substances in intervention 1 follows the described pharmacological characteristics, that guarantee its permanence in the oral mucosa to protect the entry pathway of the virus into the organism (Oropharynx). The dosage of the oral compounds was defined according to recommendations of the WHO for the modulation of the immune response (Emulsion).

Intervention 2 PLACEBO: spray and emulsion with similar color, smell, and texture but without the natural active compounds.

In the randomization visit V1, each participant will be assigned a treatment scheme, composed of intervention 1 and intervention 2, in sufficient quantity for the duration of the study. The pharmaceutical service will dispense the code of the scheme, following a sequential order, indicated in an allocation listing of the schemes on site.

Although coronary angiography is one of the best diagnostic methods of CAD, it can cause psychological problems such as stress, fear, anxiety in patients; It also causes physical problems such as bleeding, hematom and pain. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods are used by nurses to solve problems of patients, to ensure their relaxation and to improve their quality of life. With the development of technology, virtual reality (VR) glasses have been used to have fun at first, and later to provide pain management and to solve anxiety problems. VR glasses are an advanced technology that allows the patient to move into a virtual world and focus his attention on other thoughts, giving less attention to pain and anxiety. During literature search, no studies were found about the effect of using SG glasses on pain and anxiety during CAG. This research will be conducted to determine the effect of VR glasses used during CAG on pain, anxiety and hemodynamic parameters of patients who will experience coronary angiography for the first time.","Although coronary angiography is widely used in the diagnosis and evaluation of CAD and heart valve diseases, it causes patients to experience intense stress, anxiety, pain and even fear of death. The main purpose of nurses before an interventional procedure is to increase the physiological and mental well-being of the patient and to help them adapt to the procedure. Various pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods are used to manage the psychological and physical problems of patients undergoing coronary angiography. Distraction is one of the non-pharmacological interventions commonly used during medical procedures. Virtual reality (VR) is a new method that can be used to distract and prepare patients for the procedure during medical procedures. It is thought to be more effective than traditional methods. Virtual reality is a computer-generated environment in which three-dimensional interaction is possible. It projects a wide field of view in front of the user's eye through advanced head-worn screens (glasses). It is an advanced technology that allows the individual to move into a virtual environment and focus his attention on other thoughts to less consideration for pain and anxiety.

This study is a randomized controlled study to determine the effectiveness of virtual reality glasses on pain, anxiety and hemodynamic parameters during coronary angiography.The universe of the study will be the individuals who will have a coronary angiography in the Angiography Laboratory of the Department of Cardiology, Dr. Siyami Ersek Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery Training and Research Hospital.

Immediately after the procedure, the pain levels of the patients with VAS and their anxiety levels will be evaluated with STAI-I. Virtual reality glasses will be worn on the intervention group just before the procedure starts and patients will continue to wear VR glasses until the procedure is completed.

After transplant surgery, patients must take immunosuppressive therapy, which carries significant risk for drug-drug interactions and adverse medication-related events.

Transplant recipients are at an increased risk for co-morbidities traditionally managed with warfarin, such as venous thromboembolism and atrial fibrillation. Apixaban has the potential to provide safer and more effective treatment, without additional monitoring of the INR, but it has not been studied in conjunction with anti-rejection agents in this population. Apixaban is metabolized by CYP3A4 and P-gp and BCRP transporters. As part of their immunosuppressive therapy, solid organ transplant recipients are maintained on calcineurin inhibitors, which are weak CYP3A4 as well as potent P-gp and BCRP inhibitors. A study was recently undertaken to evaluate the potential drug-drug interaction between cyclosporine or tacrolimus and apixaban in healthy subjects (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03083782) . The results indicated that the change in apixaban exposure was not clinically relevant.

PK studies in healthy volunteers are a first step for determining the nature and extent of potential drug-drug interactions. However, follow-up studies in the actual patient populations are essential for ensuring safety and tolerability, and providing clinicians the confidence to use these combinations.

1. Investigate whether there are just as few infusion reactions with infliximab infusions of 60 min and 30 min.
2. Investigate patient and nurse satisfaction with infusions of 60 min and 30 min.
3. Investigate resource use in terms of total length of stay and use of nursing resources.","Our primary objective in this study is to compare the incidence of infusion reactions of Infliximab when administered over 30 minutes versus 60 minutes. We hypothesize that there will be no significant differences between the two groups, demonstrating that 30-minute infusions are as safe and effective as the current standard of 60-minute infusions.

Secondary endpoints include evaluating patient and nurse satisfaction with both infusion rates, as well as assessing resource utilization by measuring total outpatient clinic stay and nursing staff allocation.

Additionally, we will explore whether satisfaction, infusion reactions and treatment effectiveness (asessed through clinical scoring systems, endoscopic findings and laboratory results) are affected by patient demographics (such as age, sex), disease type, infusion frequency, or co-treatment with immunomodulators.

Project methodology Study design and implementation Strategy The iRAPID study is designed as a prospective, randomized, open-label, non-inferiority crossover trial designed to compare the safety and effectiveness of 30-minute versus 60-minute infliximab infusions in pediatric IBD patients. The study will be conducted at the Akershus University Hospital Pediatric and Adolescent Outpatient Clinic, where all included patients already receive infliximab infusions for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients included in the study will be randomized to receiving four consecutive fast 30-minute infusions, or four consecutive standard 60-minute infusions, after which they will switch to the alternative regimen. Each patient will serve as their own control. Randomization will be performed using a validated computer-generated randomization program.

If the patient meets inclusion and exclusion criteria, they will be invited to participate in the study. Written consent will be obtained from parents for children under the age of 16, while patients aged 16 years or older will provide their own written consent. Participation is voluntary, and one may withdraw from the study and return to the standard infusion rate of 60 minutes at any time. Based on the power calculation, 60 patients will be included in the study. This sample size allows for adjustments in dosing, intervals, and concomitant medication according to standard clinical criteria, as well as a safety margin for dropouts.

Infusion reactions will be monitored by an experienced IBD-nurse before, during and after each infusion. Infusion reactions will be dichotomized as yes or no, and categorized as mild/localized, moderate or severe using predefined clinical criteria (See references Lichtenstein, J Crohns Colitis. 2015;9(9):806-15 and Jagt et al, J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr. 2023;77(3):373-80). The criteria are based on age-appropriate values from the Pediatric Early Warning Score (PEVS), which ensures consistency in event classification and facilitates reliable safety assessments. The nurse will record vital signs, including pulse, blood pressure and respiratory rate, in addition to observe for symptoms of an infusion reaction, in accordance with the already established standard procedure for infliximab infusions.

* Criteria for mild/localized infusion reaction: Transient and short-lived pruritus, flushing (facial erythema), myalgia or low-grade fever (37.5-37.9°C).
* Criteria for moderate infusion reaction: Fever (temperature \>38°C), tachycardia (increase in heart rate \>20 beats/min above age-appropriate values in the PEVS chart), sensation of breathlessness or chest tightness or angioedema.
* Criteria for severe infusion reaction: Bronchospasm or laryngospasm, decreased consciousness, hypotension (a drop in systolic blood pressure \>20 mmHg from the normal value in the PEVS chart) or anaphylactic shock.

If an infusion reaction occurs, the patient will be assessed with a doctor, and appropriate intervention will follow standard clinical guidelines (Ref Lichtenstein, J Crohns Colitis. 2015;9(9):806-15). In case of an infusion reaction, clinical judgment will be used to assess whether there is an identifiable cause, whether the patient should continue the medication, whether additional treatment is necessary, and how the next infusion should be conducted. All adverse events, including symptoms, interventions, and assessments will be documented in the medical record and the study database.

* In the case of a mild infusion reaction, the infusion rate will be reduced and then gradually increased if tolerated.
* In the case of a moderate infusion reaction, the infusion will be stopped, pharmacological interventions will be considered and if the patient is deemed stable, the infusion will restart at a slower rate with gradual escalation.
* In the case of a severe infusion reaction, the infusion will be stopped immediately, and appropriate treatment will be administered.

Demographic data are recorded to describe the enrolled patients, including age, sex, weight and height, and disease-specific information such as IBD type, duration and extent, and previous treatment including other immunosuppressive treatment, treatment efficacy, and the duration and number of doses of infliximab therapy prior to study inclusion. At each infusion visit, the doctor will also document infliximab dose, infusion interval, and drug concentration. As part of the routine consultation, disease activity will be assessed using validated scoring systems: PUCAI for ulcerative colitis and short-PCDAI for Crohn's disease. Adjustments to treatment intervals and dosing will be made based on clinical jugdements and patient needs, independent of study participation.

Satisfaction will be evaluated using a custom-designed questionnaire completed by patients, parents and nurses. This assessment will provide qualitative insights into the impact of infusion time on both patient/caregiver experience and the clinical workflow.

The economic impact of infusion-rate will be assessed by recording:

* Total time spent in the outpatient clinic from arrival to discharge
* Total nursing time required for each infusion, including preparatory tasks (blood sampling, IV placement), infusion administration, monitoring of the patient and documentation.","University Hospital, Akershus",OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,60.0,RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,"randomized, crossover, non-inferiority open-label study",TREATMENT,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Summary

Background: three needle sizes for endoscopic ultrasonography guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) are currently available: 22 Gauge (G), 25 G and 19 G. However, well design studies comparing them regarding efficacy and feasibility are lacking.

Aims: to investigate diagnostic yield, specimen adequacy, feasibility and complications of the conventional 22 G compared with the 25 G needle.

Methods: patients ≥ 18 years, referred to EUS-FNA for a solid lesion will be considered for inclusion. Patients with suspected diagnosis of lymphoma, GIST, sarcoidosis, significant coagulopathy (APT \< 50% or platelets \< 50000/mm3), use of warfarin or other anticoagulants, use of clopidogrel within 7 days of EUS, inability or refusal to sign the informed consent and pregnancy or suspected pregnancy will be excluded.

Participants will be randomized to 22 G needle and 25 G FNA. Chi-square test will be used to compare proportions. Continuous variables will be compared using Student´s t test. A two-tailed P values of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. The diagnostic yield of 25 G and 22 G needle will be evaluated by four criteria: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. An expected rate of 85% diagnostic yield from EUS guided FNA by using 22G needle will be considered. By using a power of 80% and an α value of 0.05 would be necessary 120 patients per group to detect a 15% difference in the rate of diagnostic yield.","1\. Objectives

PRIMARY To compare diagnostic yield of stylet-free, solid lesion EUS-FNA using the 22 G FNA vs the 25 G FNA needle, in consecutive patients referred to EUS-FNA.

SECONDARY

To investigate:

1. specimen adequacy,
2. number of FNA passes,
3. ease of puncture,
4. failure of the FNA needle and
5. complications

3\. Methods

3.1. Design: prospective randomized trial.

3.2. Inclusion: Consecutive patients referred for EUS-FNA of a solid lesion will be considered for inclusion.

3.3. Exclusion: Age \< 18 years, patients with suspected diagnosis of lymphoma, GIST, sarcoidosis or other lesions in which a large amount of tissue will be required for diagnosis, significant coagulopathy (INR \> 1.5, platelets \< 50000/mm3, use of low molecular weight heparin, use of clopidogrel within 7 days of EUS), cystic lesions, or inability or refusal to sign the informed consent.

3.4. Endoscopic procedures: Informed consent will be obtained before each procedure by one of the researchers. Patients will not receive economic compensation or reimbursement of their expenses for coming to the exploration, since it is a procedure previously indicated. Then, potential candidates will be randomized to 22 G or 25 G FNA using a computer generated random sequence. There will be block randomization for a) pancreatic masses, 2) lymph nodes, or 3) all other lesions.

All examinations will be performed by two experienced endosonographers with a lineal echoendoscope (AS and SP). EUS procedures will be carried out with the patient, in left lateral position under conscious sedation using midazolam (2.5-5 mg) plus meperidine (50-100 mg) and droperidol (2.5-5 mg). Before performing the EUS-FNA biopsy, a complete examination of the pancreas, liver as well as other vicinity organs will be performed.

EUS-FNA passes will be performed without stylet until sample adequacy or until a maximum of 5 FNA passes in pancreatic lesions or 3 FNA passes in other lesions. In case of inadequate sample after 3 passes, or needle failure, cross over to the other type of needle is allowed. Ease of puncture will be scored qualitatively as poor (scored 1), good (scored 2) or excellent (scored 3).\[14\] FNA failure will be also reported. All procedures will be digitally videotaped. The examinations will be reviewed by a endosonographer blinded to the type of needle used and visibility of the needle will be scored (score 1 ""poor"", score 2 ""good"", score 3 ""excellent"").\[14\] After the procedure, patients will be monitored in the recovery room at least 60 minutes before discharge. Immediate complications will be assessed and recorded by nurses and/or physicians during and after the procedure while the patient was recovering from sedation.

3.5. Cytological analysis: All passes will be read by one experienced cytopathologist on-site utilizing microscopic evaluation of air-dried slides stained with Diff-Quik (International Reagents Co., Ltd., Kobe, Japan). The cytopathologist will be blinded to the type of needle used. The final cytological diagnosis was made using a standard Papanicolaou stain. For each lesion, the cytologist assessed sample adequacy: cellularity (score 1 ""poor"", score 2 ""good"", score 3 ""excellent""),\[14\] and bloodiness (score 1 ""minimal"", score 2 ""moderate"", score 3 ""significant"")\[21\] and the presence or absence of malignancy (""positive""/""negative""/""suspicious""/ inconclusive).

3.6. Follow up Lesions will be considered malignant in the following cases: positive cytological diagnosis, positive histological diagnosis and clinical or radiological progression in the next 6 months. In case of negative results in the cytological diagnosis absence of clinical worsening and radiologic progression at least in the following 6 months after FNA will be required.

3.7. Data collection Clinical data will be prospectively collected and saved in a database including: demographic information (age and gender), size and location of the target lesion (pancreas, lymph node, liver, adrenal gland, others) and technical and procedure variables: FNA path (esophagus, stomach, duodenum), number of needle passes, needle visibility, ease to puncture, needle failure, cellularity, bloodiness, cytological diagnosis, final diagnosis, immediate complications.

4\. Statistical analysis Results for continuous variables will be expressed as means and standard deviations. Categorical variables will be expressed as frequencies and percentages. Chi-square test will be used to compare proportions. Continuous variables will be compared using Student´s t test. A two-tailed P values of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. Data were analyzed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences v. 15.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The diagnostic yield of 15 G and 22 G needle will be evaluated by four criteria: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value.

Sample size An expected rate of diagnostic yield from EUS guided FNA by using 22G needle of 85% will be considered.

Experimental administration of metreleptin (synthetically produced leptin) to patients with anorexia nervosa has produced positive results. This study tests the effect of metreleptin in comparison with placebo, which could potentially make treatment easier. The aim of the study is to investigate whether treatment with metreleptin can help to reduce the symptoms of anorexia nervosa and improve mood and weight.","Anorexia nervosa (AN) mainly affects young people, especially young women. AN is one of the most lethal psychiatric disorders. Treatment often proves to be very difficult, and AN course is frequently chronic. Specific pharmacological therapies for AN are lacking. Recent studies have shown that metabolic alterations play a great role in the etiology and pathogenesis of AN. An important metabolic alteration playing a role in the etiology and pathogenesis of AN is the hormone leptin. Patients with AN show hypoleptinemia. The role of hypoleptinemia in the neuroendocrine adaptation to starvation seems to induce emotional, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms of AN. From a theoretical point of view, pharmacotherapy augmenting leptin levels in patients with AN have a great therapeutic potential. Recently, positive effects with experimental administration of subcutaneous metreleptin in few young patients with severe AN have been observed. Importantly, no side effects have been observed. For all these reasons, the present study will investigate - with a double blind design - the therapeutic effect of metreleptin in patients with AN.

Despite the relatively short survival expectancy following device implantation, many ICD recipients do not participate in advance care planning and either have no advance directives or advance directives that do not address end-of-life (EOL) decisions related to ICDs. The prevalence of ICD recipients with general advance directives ranges from 10-30%. Of these advance directives, only 2% have language related to the ICD specifically, leaving hundreds of thousands of ICD recipients at risk of unnecessary and painful shocks. Approximately 30% of ICD recipients will receive a shock in the active dying phase of a terminal illness, from which resuscitation was not intended.

Communication among family members is integral to EOL decision-making. Appropriate quality discussions can create concordance of perceptions and well thought out advance care plans for EOL that are congruent with the values and beliefs of the chronically ill and family members. The Hello Game (commonpractice.com) was created to encourage conversations among families about EOL choices. The gameplay presents a series of questions that include practical and philosophical question prompts. These questions range from 1) What kind of music would you like to be listening to on your last day alive? to 2) Who should your health care surrogate seek advice from if they need to make a decision about your care? Participation in the game has been found to improve advance care planning behaviors.

The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility and efficacy of the GAME-EOL intervention, which uses the Hello Game to encourage and facilitate quality EOL discussions between ICD recipients and family members.

As well, sharp debridement is often associated with pain, causing patient distress, and thereby occasionally contributing to inadequacy of debridement, leading to a delay in wound healing. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of the Sciton Laser in reducing bacterial load and patient distress in patients with chronic wounds, in efforts to expedite the wound healing process.","Chronic wounds are a debilitating affliction, affecting a substantial portion of the population worldwide and incurring staggering healthcare economic costs (1,2). Included among chronic wounds are venous leg ulcers, which are known to cause considerable pain, and can impact patient quality of life, thereby complicating wound care (3). The exact pathophysiology and etiology of the prolonged course of chronic wounds are poorly understood, but are thought to be multi-factorial in nature. Given the exposure of chronic wounds to the environment, they harbor a diverse microbial flora. Specifically, there is evidence that biofilm produced by these microbes are a large contributor to their non-healing nature (4). Debridement is considered an integral part of wound management with its ability to remove necrotic tissue and bacterial biofilm, in addition to stimulating release of cytokines and growth factors that promote wound healing (5). However, sharp debridement, the gold standard in wound care, is often ineffective for painful wounds.

The effect of lasers on wound healing have been well-studied both in in vitro and in vivo models. Beneficial effects of low-level laser therapy in wound healing in animal and human studies has been established. However, extrapolation of this data is limited by study design and light dosimetry (6). Laser energy used for surgical excision is a lesser-known debridement technique that has been largely limited to burn scar treatment (7,8,9,10). Lasers are electro-optical devices that emit a focused beam of intense monochromatic light in the visible and infrared radiation spectrums. Since their start in the 1960s, lasers have been successfully utilized in many fields of medicine. Lasers for wound debridement began in the 1970s, with the successful report of a continuous-beam carbon dioxide (CO2) laser used for skin graft preparation of infected decubitus ulcers (11). Laser debridement is based on the controlled vaporization of the superficial layers of the wound bed. This results in the removal of the tissue containing unwanted microbial and necrotic particles. The laser type and the number of passes performed determine the depth of tissue ablation (12). Unlike other methods dependent on the clinician's manual control, laser debridement is electronically controlled, improving precision and reducing the risk of healthy tissue damage. Advantages of laser debridement include precision and uniformity of tissue ablation, which reduces trauma to the wound bed, improving patient comfort. To reduce thermal damage to healthy tissue, several improvements in laser technology have been made over the years. By utilizing a pulsed-beam system, laser energy is delivered in high-power, rapid succession pulses, resulting in short duration and high temperature exposure of target tissue, thereby minimizing thermal injury.

Erbium:YAG (Er:YAG) lasers, with a wavelength of 2940-nm are widely used in the dermatologic community for skin resurfacing, for anti-aging and acne-related purposes (13). Skin ablation with the erbium laser is very precise, and allows for accurate assessment of the resurfacing depth (12,14,15). Since Er:YAG laser energy has greater than twelve times more water absorption efficiency than CO2 lasers, water in the tissue is rapidly expanded to eject the charred debris from the wound surface without leaving behind a necrotic eschar (12,16,17). The Er:YAG laser provides distinct advantages in precise ablation control and the reduction of residual necrotic tissue burden with minimal procedural discomfort, making the Er:YAG laser the most suitable device for laser wound debridement. Preliminary studies demonstrate remarkable patient pain reduction after laser debridement, resulting in more thorough removal of necrotic tissue and biofilm/bacterial load. Additionally, the extent of laser debridement is determined by the laser settings, as opposed to the individual operator's dexterity and skill, thereby providing better control over the wound bed preparation, producing more predictable and reproducible outcomes.",Stanford University,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,22.0,RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,"A portion of the patients will be randomized to sharp debridement first, then laser for the second debridement.

This initiative is presented under the urgent circumstances of the fulminant pandemic caused by this lethal disease, which is known as COVID-19 and has spread across the globe causing death and disrupting the normal function of modern society. The grounds for the proposal are rooted in existing knowledge on the components and pharmacological features of this formulation and their relevance to the current understanding of the disease process being addressed.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness results from the immediate response to the viral infection as well as from a subsequent host inflammatory response. Systemic proinflammatory cytokines and biomarkers are elevated as the disease progresses towards its advanced stages, and correlate with worse chances of survival.

Serum cytokine levels that are elevated in patients with Covid-19-associated cytokine storm include interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, IP-10, TNF, interferon-γ, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) 1α and 1β, and VEGF. Higher interleukin-6 levels are strongly associated with shorter survival. The relative frequencies of circulating activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and plasmablasts are increased in Covid-19. In addition to the elevated systemic cytokine levels and activated immune cells, several clinical and laboratory abnormalities, such as elevated CRP and d-dimer levels, hypoalbuminemia, renal dysfunction, and effusions, are also observed in Covid-19. Laboratory test results reflecting hyper inflammation and tissue damage were found to predict worsening outcomes in Covid-19.

CimetrA, comprising Artemisinin, Curcumin, Boswellia, and Vitamin C in a nanoparticular formulation, has been studied on patients with COVID-19 in a randomized double-blind control Phase II study (MGC-006 - under a previous product name - ArtemiC). The study product demonstrated excellent safety and efficacy profiles.

Experiments performed in vitro with CimetrA demonstrated the ability to reduce cytokine elevation in response to stimulation of human PBMC preparations.

The currently proposed Multi-center multinational-controlled study is designed to include 252 adult patients who suffer from moderate COVID-19 infection. Safety will be assessed through collection and analysis of adverse events, blood and urine laboratory assessments, and vital signs.

4a0a904b651f6ef0,NCT00873782,Safety Study of Transvenous Limb Perfusion in Human Muscular Dystrophy,Safety and Feasibility of Transvenous Limb Perfusion With Normal Saline in Human Muscular Dystrophy,,U54AR056953,"Muscular dystrophies are inherited disorders in which the skeletal and heart muscles become progressively weaker, sometimes leading to permanent disability. Current treatments aim to control symptoms as much as possible, but there is no cure. Gene therapy, in which defective genes causing the disorder are corrected, is a potential treatment option and is in the process of being developed for muscular dystrophies. This study will determine the safety and feasibility of a particular delivery method for gene therapy that could be used in the future to treat people with muscular dystrophies. Only normal saline, and no active treatment, will be used in this study.","There are many types of muscular dystrophies, all of which are progressive, degenerative genetic disorders. One type is Becker's muscular dystrophy, which involves slowly worsening muscle weakness of the legs and pelvis and which can lead to cardiomyopathy, deformities, respiratory failure, and permanent disability. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, another type, is also characterized by progressive muscle weakness, first affecting the muscles around the shoulder girdle and hips and possibly affecting other muscles as the disorder progresses. Complications of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy can include abnormal heart rhythms, joint contractures, difficulties with activities of daily living, significant loss of mobility, and permanent disability. There is no cure for muscular dystrophies. Current treatments, such as steroids, mobility aids, physical therapy, and respiratory care, can decrease some of the complications, but there is a clear need for a curative therapy.

The genetic basis of muscular dystrophies is well understood, which makes gene therapy a potential treatment option in the future. A key step in developing gene therapy involves first ensuring safe delivery of genetic material into a single limb of a patient before using active treatment in the patient's entire body. High-pressure, high-volume transvenous limb perfusion, in which fluid is forced under high pressure into arm and leg muscles through the veins, has shown the greatest potential as a delivery method. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and feasibility of this method with normal saline in people who have Becker's muscular dystrophy or limb-girdle muscular dystrophy.

Participation in this study will last up to 4 weeks. At an initial baseline visit, participants will undergo water emersion measurements of their arm and leg, nerve testing, and muscle strength testing. About 1 to 2 weeks later, participants will enter the pediatric intensive care unit for up to 36 hours. During the inpatient stay, participants will undergo the high-pressure, high-volume transvenous limb perfusion procedure with normal saline in one of their arms or legs. Throughout the hospital stay, breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure will be monitored. Medication will be available to control any discomfort or pain experienced by participants. Each subsequent participant will receive more fluid pumped at a higher pressure and with a tighter tourniquet than the previous participant, as long as no problems or adverse effects are detected. Some of the participants will undergo an MRI immediately after the perfusion procedure. About 1 to 2 weeks after the inpatient stay, participants will attend a follow-up visit that will include repeat nerve and muscle strength testing, a blood draw, photos of limbs, and an ultrasound of the leg blood vessels if the participant's leg was used during the perfusion procedure.","University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill",OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,16.0,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,,TREATMENT,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Unfortunately, less than 65 % of age-eligible persons in the US are actually screened for CRC. The leading methods, colonoscopy and FIT (fecal immunochemical test) testing, both have patient-associated barriers that reduce their use. The combination of bowel preparation and procedure time are barriers to colonoscopy, while stool handling as part of the sampling protocol reduces FIT usage.

It has been hypothesized and supported by a variety of preference studies that the availability of a blood-based assay for CRC screening would increase patient participation and adherence to CRC screening by reducing barriers that prevent participation.

This study is designed to investigate the relative participation in CRC screening in average risk, screening eligible patients with demonstrated non-adherence to guideline-recommended screening modalities. Participation with the fecal immunochemical test (FIT) and the blood-based Epi proColon® test will be examined. Screening eligible average-risk patients identified as non-adherent by medical record will be eligible for the study. Potential subjects will be recruited to participate in a study via mailing and/or at a clinic visit. All study subjects will be enrolled at a clinic visit and will be randomized in two study arms.

Rates of adherence will be compared between those that accept and complete the blood test and those that accept and complete the FIT test. A passive control, usual care arm will comprise subjects meeting eligibility criteria, but not recruited for or participating in the study.

In conjunction with published data (Johnson et al, 2014), the relative utilization of the blood test will be compared to the screening participation via FIT.

The current project aims at a multidisciplinary assessment of respiratory, cardiac, sleep and mental health sequelae, three months after SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in order to better characterize these complications.

Three aspects will be targeted in this study : (i) long-term monitoring of deterioration in lung function, (ii) screening for sleep respiratory disorders (sleep apnea syndrome, obesity hypoventilation syndrome) and iii) characterization of sleep disorders and design of specialized intervention to improve sleep quality.

This study is a prospective, multicentric cohort study that aims at constituting a cohort of 400 patients who will be screened for pulmonary, cardiac, sleep, or psychological sequelae 3 months after their diagnosis. They will be then followed for 5 years. The primary outcome will be the diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) 3 months after the diagnosis. Other secondary outcomes will include:

* prevalence of sleep disorders and sleep disordered breathing 3 months after diagnosis and their evolution until 5 years;
* prevalence of cardiac, exercise capacity, respiratory and ventilatory muscles impairments at 3 months and their evolution until 5 years;
* characterization of homogeneous groups of patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have respiratory, cardiometabolic and/or sleep complications, 3 months after diagnosis (latent class analysis) and evaluate their evolution until 5 years
* determine the prevalence of radiological sequelae at 3 months, and their evolution until 5 years

Based on varenicline's specific affinity for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that are implicated in alcohol reward circuitry, it appears to be a good candidate for treatment of alcohol dependence. Alcohol can exert its reinforcing and dopamine-enhancing effects through activation of nicotinic receptors. In addition to its partial agonist activity at heteromeric α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, varenicline has also been shown to be a full agonist at homomeric α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. That full agonism at α7 may be key in reducing alcohol withdrawal and craving during early alcohol abstinence, and thus reducing relapse, as α7 receptors are implicated in the neural reward circuitry activated by alcohol use.",University of Pennsylvania,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,40.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,TREATMENT,,,QUADRUPLE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

In atrial fibrillation, there is a risk that clots can form in the heart, especially in the left atrium. If these clots come loose, there is a risk of stroke. To prevent strokes, patients with atrial fibrillation and status post ICB can be treated with anticoagulants. This medication therapy prevents blood clots from forming in the heart, but can also cause bleeding. Another therapy option is the occlusion of the left atrium. After closure of the left atrium, only a short anticoagulation therapy is necessary until the occluder has healed. The aim of the study is to compare these two treatment approaches. In this study only already approved drugs and occlusion systems will be used.","Within the current trial, two novel strategies are tested in a randomized fashion in patients with atrial fibrillation and status post intracranial bleeding. Patients with ICH were usually excluded from the large NOAC trials and were also not representatively included in the large Watchman device trials. On the other hand, registries show that there is a significant proportion of patients with status post ICH that were implanted with a LAA closure device in clinical routine, and also there are those patients treated with NOAC due to their high stroke risk, despite the risk of recurrent ICH.

Both therapies, NOAC and LAA closure are effective in preventing stroke in patients with AF at high risk for stroke. Also, for both therapies there is evidence for prevention of bleedings, especially intracranial bleeding events.

Patients within the LAA closure group will have the chance after successful closure of the LAA to quit oral anticoagulation medication and therefore reduce their lifetime risk for bleeding and recurrent bleeding. Patients in the NOAC group are provided with an excellent protection against stroke and a significant reduced bleeding risk compared to Vitamin K antagonist therapy.

The trial will help to develop data and hopefully guidelines for management of patients with AF and status post intracranial bleedings.

.","I. Materials:

1. Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA)
2. Nano propolis
3. Nano curcumin
4. Glass ionomer

II. Methods:

Sample size calculation:

Sample size calculation was performed using G\*Power version 3.1.9.7 based on the results of a previous study. The predicted sample size (n) was (54), i.e., 18 samples per group of the three groups, to detect results of dentin bridge thickness.

Sample preparation:

Patients will be recruited from the department of Pediatric Dentistry and Dental Public Heath, October 6 university. The study sample will be recruited among the children between 7 to 13 years old. The young permanent tooth eruption stage will be determined by the patient's age and radiographic evaluation before enrolling in the research study.

Before treatment, a periapical radiograph will be taken with ultra-low dose mode to assess the tooth radiographically for any sign of irreversible pulpitis.

Each tooth will be infiltrated with local anesthesia using 4% articaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine (Septanest, Septodont, France). The tooth will be isolated with a rubber dam and washed with 0.12% chlorhexidine. The cavity will be prepared, and the infected enamel and dentin will be removed with a round bur. The carious dentin close to the pulp will be removed using a spoon excavator. The pulp exposure position will be identified, and the inflamed pulp tissue (1.5-2 mm) will be gently removed using an abrasive diamond bur at high speed with copious sterilized normal saline. The remaining healthy pulp will be rinsed with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite, and moist, sterilized cotton pellets will be placed over the pulp stumps with light pressure for 2 min to achieve hemostasis. If the bleeding could not be controlled, the tooth will be excluded from this study. MTA or nano propolis or nano curcumin will then be placed over the remaining healthy pulp per the manufacturer's recommendation. To cover the exposure area, MTA and or nano propolis or nano curcumin will be placed using an amalgam carrier and non-toothed Adson forceps, respectively. The cavities will be lined with glass ionomer cement (Vitrebond, 3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA), and a permanent composite restoration (Filtex Z350, 3M ESPE, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) will be placed after 6 months. After treatment, a periapical radiograph and CBCT (Planmeca. Romexis. Fenland) will be immediately taken with ultra-low dose mode (90 kVp, 5.6 mA, 4 × 5 cm FOV, and 0.2 vowel size) to serve as the baseline with a reduced dose, due to the need for future follow-ups.

The CBCT will be performed using an ultralow dose, small field of view, and appropriate radiation protection as described by the American Association of Endodontics (AAE) and the American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology (AAOMR), and the European Society of Endodontology guidelines.

Shielding devices, a leaded thyroid collar, leaded glasses, and a leaded apron, will be used to protect the patient's thyroid gland, eye lens, body, respectively. The patients and their parents will be interviewed by telephone on day 1 and day 7 post-surgery about any pain or adverse reactions related to the treatment. Paracetamol will be prescribed if the patients had pain, however, no antibiotic will be used following the surgery. The patients will receive a 3-month follow-up clinical and periapical radiographic examination, together with 6 months clinical and CBCT examinations. The clinical and radiograph evaluations will be performed by blinded experienced endodontist and radiologist. The examiners will be trained in the evaluation criteria prior to the study. To determine the reliability of the evaluations, Kappa scores will be determined by the 2 examiners re-evaluating all cases 1 month after the initial evaluation performed. The intra- and inter-examiner Kappa scores of the clinical evaluation will be 1.0. For the radiographic evaluation, the intra-rater and inter-rater reliabilities will be 0.91 and 0.89, respectively. When there will be a disagreement, both examiners discussed the clinical and radiographic findings to achieve a consensus.

When it involves the ventral skull base, a surgical closure may be achieved using endoscopic skull base surgery techniques. The major principles remain in achieving a watertight closure that can also support the brain (and avoid brain sagging) in case of extensive skull base defects. Surgical techniques are well described. Many clinical factors may influence the successful rate of the reconstruction. However, there is a lack of clinical study on perioperative management of CSF leaks. The purpose of this study is to gather the opinion of skull base surgeons on the post-operative management of patients to avoid CSF leak recurrence.

This study aims to compare the ability of physicians versus an AI model to asses the Hill grade during gastroscopy.","Objective:

The primary goal of this study is to compare the accuracy in determining the Hill classification during gastroscopy between an artificial intelligence (AI) based system and physicians performing the examination. Secondary outcomes include evaluation of the per-class accuracy and other statistical measures such as precision, recall and f1 score.

Study Design:

Single center, endoscopist blinded study. The model considered in a previous study achieved a mean accuracy of 88%. All participants initially attended a lecture serving as a refresher regarding the Hill classification. Subsequently, physicians were asked to provide the Hill classification for test images expert annotated images depicting different Hill grades, achieving mean accuracy of 72%. Thus 127 paired measurements are required. Taking patient drop-out into consideration, at least 159 patients need to be recruited. Upon examination of the flap-valve during endoscopy, the physician is required to store an image of the flap-valve during retroflexion, which is part of the standard procedure, based on which they determine the Hill classification. The prediction of the AI model on this image is considered the model output and is considered the model's output. A group of three expert endoscopists determines the Hill classification for each image, based on majority vote, which is treated as the gold standard.

AI setup and limitations:

There are no limitations caused by the AI. The method performs a frame-by-frame analysis of the recording. These images are parsed from the AI based system in order to obtain predictions. The only interactions required with the method is a button press that initiates the examination recording process and a second button press to terminate the recording. This is performed at the beginning and end of the examination respectively. The model used in this study is an updated version of the model reported in a preliminary study, that has been trained with more data together with an auxiliary output for predicting if the Hill classification is relevant to the shown image.

Study population:

All adult patients appointed for gastroscopy that do not match the exclusion criteria will be asked for informed consent. Exclusion criteria include previous surgical interventions or altered anatomy that prevents the proper examination of the flap valve, examinations where the flap-valve is not inspected, and examinations where the expert committee does not produce a majority vote.

Intervention:

The physician performs the examination as usual. Upon inspection of the flap valve, the physician captures an image of the examination, as usual, and gives their assessment of the Hill grade. The output of the model for the same image is considered the model prediction. The physician is blinded to the model's prediction.",Wuerzburg University Hospital,OTHER,SPONSOR,OBSERVATIONAL,False,ACTUAL,195.0,,,,,CASE_ONLY,PROSPECTIVE,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

SETTING: James J. Peters Veterans Affairs Medical Center (Bronx, NY) BACKGROUND: Poor skin permeability precludes the use of transdermal route from being used in common clinical practice for rapid and precise administration of medications through intact skin that are expected to have a systemic effect. The researchers determined the relative effectiveness of an unconventional transdermal iontophoresis technique for the administration of Vitamin B12 (V.B12) under three different skin preparatory conditions.

METHODS: During this study, Vitamin B12 (V.B12) was administered through the skin of volunteer human research subjects. Iontophoresis was used as transdermal medication delivery modality after pre-treatment of the skin in 3 different ways. The sequence of skin preparations was arranged in a random order for each subject. Method 1 was called ""No Prep"", serving as the control approach; method 2 was called ""Oleic Acid"" application to the skin for 40 minutes; and method 3 was hair ""Epilation"" (e.g. hair removal by plucking). Fifteen milligrams of aqueous solution of V.B12 was administered through intact, previously unused skin of an anterior thigh during all 3 tests. Chemoluminescence, on an automated laboratory reader Advia Centaur-XP, was used to determine the serum concentration of V.B12 prior to and after transdermal iontophoretic delivery. All 3 experiments were performed on the same day within an hour of each other. The subject's blood was drawn prior and 10 minutes after the 20-minute long sessions of transdermal V.B12 iontophoresis. We were able to calculate the increase in serum V.B12 concentration and based on estimated blood volume, the total quantity and percent dose delivered systemically.","In order to quantify the changes in skin permeability to drugs delivered by ION under three different preparatory conditions, we used V.B12 as a model substance. Its choice was dictated by its inherent safety, positive charge and quantification of serum concentration readily available through our clinical laboratory. We compared the effects of unprepared skin (No Prep), oil-soaked skin \[ref. 9-12\] (Oleic Acid) and skin from which hair have been plucked out of (Epilation), on the serum concentrations of V.B12 before and after administration via ION.

Veterans and non-Veterans without SCI were recruited for the study comparing the three skin preparation methods. This prospective, skin preparatory method sequence-randomized study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the James J. Peters VA Medical Center (JJPVAMC). The ION equipment used was a standard FDA-approved wired ION controller unit (IBOX by Dynatronics) and 4mL ION electrodes by (ionto+ by Richmar). The skin was prepared using 1 of the 3 techniques, performed in a random order. Each subject was assigned a 2-digit sequential number. A random-numbers table was used to assign the sequence of methods to each subject. A single positive electrode patch containing 4mL of a water-based solution with 15mg of V.B12 was used per experiment. One negative electrode patch was also used to complete the circuit. Blood was drawn prior to the first administration. Thirty minutes after the start of the ION delivery of the V.B12 through the skin of anterior thigh, the blood was drawn again. The blood was centrifuged for 5 minutes and delivered to the clinical laboratory for testing without delay. Serum concentration of V.B12 was measured using chemoluminescence on an automated laboratory reader Advia Centaur-XP. The experiments were conducted sequentially in a timely fashion, performed on the same day and within a span of 3 hours. Blood was drawn for a total of 4 times per subject.

The ""No Prep"" technique was performed by simply wiping the two skin surfaces on an anterior thigh, where the electrodes were later attached, with two-70% isopropyl alcohol prep. pads. The skin surface destined for positive electrode application was sprayed with a thin layer of 20% Benzocaine (Americaine aerosol spray can) and covered with an occlusive plastic film for 10 minutes. The film was then removed and the skin was cleansed with water-moistened paper towel, followed by one alcohol prep. pad.

The ""Oleic Acid"" technique involved first wiping the two skin patches and later soaking the skin patch, where the positive electrode was going to be placed, with oil called oleic acid for 40 minutes. The oil was then wiped off with a paper napkin and an alcohol pad. That same skin area was sprayed with a thin layer of 20% Benzocaine (Americaine aerosol spray container) and covered with an occlusive plastic film for 10 minutes. The film was then removed and the skin was cleansed with water-moistened paper towel, followed by one alcohol prep.

The ""Hair Epilation"" technique involved first wiping the two skin patches with 2-70% isopropyl alcohol skin preps and sprayed with a thin layer of 20% Benzocaine (Americaine aerosol spray container) and covered with an occlusive plastic film for 10 minutes. The film was removed and the skin was cleansed with de-ionized water followed by alcohol prep. Hair removal, using an epilator machine (Remington EP 7030), was performed by clearing an area of 5x5cm or 2x2 inch square. The epilated area was then covered with a thin layer of 0.2% Sodium Lauryl Sulfate (SLS) in de-ionized water.

After each of the skin preparations and without delay, 15mg of methylcobalamin dissolved in 4mL of de-ionized water soaked into the anode patch reservoir was applied to the designated skin of the proximal anterior thighs. The 7x7cm skin area under the negative electrode was wiped with an alcohol pad and 0.5mL of 1% citric acid dissolved in 0.9% normal saline solution was applied to the negative electrode's skin contact surface. The return (negative) electrode was then attached to the skin 10cm from the positive electrode.

An elevated room temperature of 73-78 degrees Fahrenheit (25 degrees Celsius) was maintained in the room for the purposes of maintaining adequate blood flow in the peripheral dermal capillaries. No exclusion criteria for diseases that decrease capillary perfusion such as diabetes have been utilized. As a result, 2 of the 10 subjects who participated in this study had a diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus type 2.

IBOX ION device was attached to the electrodes by way of wire leads and a multimeter was attached to the electrodes in parallel in order to record the skin's electrical resistivity prior to and after ION. Throughout the 20-minute ION session, voltage exerted by the IBOX was recorded at regular intervals. The voltage was automatically adjusted by the IBOX to deliver a pre-set constant electrical current of 4mA/minute. Throughout the procedure subjects were asked about the presence of any sensations associated with the ION including effects of the medication being administered.",James J.

375733c7bb853f77,NCT02787759,Falls-based Training for Walking Post-Stroke,Falls-based Training to Improve Balance and Mobility Post-Stroke,FBT,F120425008,"We propose a study that uses challenging walking exercises as a research training program and compare balance and walking abilities against a non-challenging exercise program, in a group of 40 people with long standing (\> 6 months) weakness that occurred after a stroke. Our main balance measure will be changes with the Berg Balance Score and Dynamic Gait Index, and our main walking measure will be walking speed over a 10 meter walkway and distance walked over a six minute period. Also, we will measure balance confidence, using scores on Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale, changes in quality of life as measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale, SF-36 and Stroke Impact Scale. If challenging exercises are shown to be more effective than non-challenging exercises, then we will share this promising new approach with the community in hopes of improving people's lives after a stroke.","In 2009, the American Heart Association (AHA) reported that the incidence of hemiplegia in patients six months post-stroke and over 65 years of age was 50%. Stroke survivors with chronic hemiplegia are at an increased risk for falling due to poor motor control, muscle weakness, and balance problems. While over-ground walking training has been shown to improve muscle coordination and functional movement outcomes in stroke survivors, the physical challenges to balance during the training is limited due to safety concerns. The limited training does not reflect the individuals' natural environment, which studies have shown to contain hazards that put post-stroke individuals at greater risk of loss of balance and falls. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to safely implement challenging environmental-hazard tasks as a way to effect greater improvements in walking capability post-stroke.

The usage of body weight support (BWS) during treadmill training has been shown to improve walking speed, but without the context of real world hazards, individuals may not gain improvements in balance related tasks nor gain confidence in moving through hazardous environments. The purpose of this study is to introduce a novel, falls-based training (FBT) approach that will enable individuals to be challenged at high levels of balance and walking safely, using a new robotic device called the KineAssist®, and to determine its relative effects compared to traditional body weight support treadmill training (BWSTT). We hypothesize that like the standard BWSTT, the novel FBT will result in improved walking speed, greater 6 minute walking distance, and greater Berg Balance scores. We also hypothesize that FBT will result in greater gains than BWSTT after the training, with a greater difference 6 months after training. In addition to the walking tests and the Berg Balance scale, we will compare the outcomes of the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS), the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS)SF-36 Health Survey, the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale, the K-9 task Balance test, and the Dynamic Gait Index (DGI).",University of Alabama at Birmingham,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,54.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,TREATMENT,,,SINGLE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

About 4,000 adults will be randomly selected, administered a short questionnaire, and given vouchers that will offer them HIV self-tests at randomly allocated prices and distribution sites. The study will also test whether the provision of HIV self-tests can be targeted more cost-effectively to reach high-risk persons and non- recent testers. Last, the study will explore whether demand for repeated HIV self-testing is contingent on the price offered initially.","This study is a field experiment that seeks to obtain ""revealed preference"" estimates of the likelihood that individuals will purchase oral fluid-based HIV self-tests at alternative prices. Such an approach is useful for estimating the price sensitivity (or elasticity) of demand for HIV self-tests. The study will also estimate the extent to which demand for self-tests differs by certain distribution channels such as retail outlets, public sector health facilities, and other community-based venues. Importantly, the experiment will also test whether the provision of HIV self-tests can be targeted more cost-effectively to reach high-risk persons and non-recent testers by examining the demand for self-tests in these populations in responses to various prices and distribution strategies. The results of the study will provide vital information required by policy makers and implementers on the optical pricing and distribution strategies for introducing HIV self-tests and scaling up HIVST in resource-limited settings. In a subsequent study with additional funding, the study will also seek to determine the long-term implications of offering self-tests at very low prices initially; specifically, it will assess whether free distribution initially suppresses individuals' willingness to pay for self-tests in the future. Roughly 12 months after the initial voucher offer, participants who provided a mobile phone number they can access within their household will be contacted via phone-based text messages and offered the same HIV self-tests again at one common non-zero price.

The aim of this prospective, randomized, parallel arm, blind clinical trial is to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes following non-surgical treatment of mild peri-implant defects using Labrida Bioclean with or without the application of tetracycline slurry.

Research Hypothesis:

The hypothesis is that the adjunctive application of tetracycline slurry will enhance the clinical and radiographic results of non-surgical treatment of mild peri-implant defects (defined as peri-implant bone loss 3-6 mm with pocket depths 6 mm or deeper) with Labrida Bioclean. Probing pocket depth (PPD) reduction will be the primary outcome, whereas clinical attachment level (CAL), radiographic bone fill (RBF), recession depth (REC), modified bleeding index (mBI), presence of plaque (PL) , suppuration on probing (SUP) and Matrix Metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8) levels on peri-implant sulcus fluid (PISF) will constitute the secondary outcome measures.

Groups:

Active comparator group: Debridement with Labrida Bioclean

Experimental group: Debridement with Labrida Bioclean and irrigation with tetracycline slurry

At the end of the treatment procedure patients will be given oral hygiene instructions and specifically patients of the experimental group will be instructed to refrain from oral hygiene for 24 hours before initiating oral hygiene. 1 month after therapy patients will be re-evaluated as a mean of PPD, CAL, REC, mBI, PL, SUP measurements and levels of MMP-8 on PISF. 3 months after therapy will be re-evaluated for second time as in the 1 month re-evaluation. Furthermore, treatment will be repeated as it was randomized on baseline. On 6 month re-evaluation PPD, CAL, REC, mBI, PL, SUP measurements will be made and also a periapical x-ray will be taken to compare the peri-implant bone level with the respective bone level on the x-ray of the baseline. On all of these appointments oral hygiene instructions and motivation will be given to the patients.","Inflammation and loss of attachment around dental implants (i.e., peri-implantitis) is a growing issue within the field of dental implantology. Studies show that regular cleaning of dental implants is important to avoid progression of mucositis to peri-implantitis. Instruments specifically designed for this purpose are however scarce and mostly not scientifically validated with respect to efficacy and safety. Leaving remnants of the instrument on the implant surface or scratching the surface may also impede optimal peri-implant healing. Currently used maintenance procedures of implants comprise use of titanium curettes, plastic or carbon fiber curettes, ultrasound or lasers which is cumbersome, time consuming and in the example of lasers rather costly. Scientific evidence for the effectiveness of such interventions is also variable. It is also suggested that some procedures may even cause more problems rather than improving peri-implant health. One obvious risk factor is to leave foreign material, such as nylon, carbon or non-inert metals, in an environment comprising of bone, titanium implant and inflamed soft tissue which may cause a foreign body reaction and even further aggravation of the bone loss around the implant.

So far there is no device specifically developed for cleaning dental implants, neither with mucositis nor with mild peri-implantitis, and it is of utmost importance to develop methods optimized for therapy with the aim to prolong the life span of ailing dental implants.

As for the chitosan biodegradable brush, the brush bristles of the test device (BioClean Trademark - TM, LABRIDA AS, Oslo Norway) are made of the biopolymer chitosan. Any debris left from the chitosan bristles is completely biocompatible and will dissolve or be resorbed thus not causing harm to the tissues surrounding the implant. Chitosan is made from chitin derived from shell of marine crustaceans such as shrimp and crab, however chemically modified and thus not even considered to be animally derived. Chitosan has been approved for use in e.g., surgical bandages, as a haemostatic agent and as dietary supplement used in a wide range of nutritional and health products. Chitosan has also been documented to be non-allergenic and it has been suggested that chitosan has anti-inflammatory properties.

In three previous research project performed at the Department of Periodontology, Institute of Clinical Dentistry, University of Oslo the safety and potential to reduce peri-implant inflammation was tested. In the first study, which was a pilot consecutive case series of six months duration, 13 patients with 13 implants diagnosed with peri-implant mucositis were treated with the device. Significant improvements in parameters of inflammation were demonstrated up to 6 months after baseline treatment. In a randomized, split mouth, examiner blinded, clinical trial of 6 months duration, including 12 patients diagnosed with peri-implant mucositis the chitosan brush was compared with titanium curettes. Both groups demonstrated significant reductions in clinical parameters between baseline, 4 weeks and 6 months but the test implants treated with the chitosan brush had a better improvement in BoP (Bleeding on Probing) at 2 weeks and a better improvement in PPD (Probing Pocket Depth) at 2 weeks and 4 weeks as compared with the implants treated with the titanium curettes. None of the implants demonstrated progression in bone-loss during the course of the study. In recent multicenter consecutive case series in 6 centers in Sweden, Norway and Italy it was demonstrated that treatment with a chitosan brush of implants affected by mild peri-implantitis lead to a reduction in parameters of inflammation up to three months after baseline. No control group was however included in this study and it will be important to further evolve on these early results also comparing treatment with a chitosan brush with a more conventional treatment strategy.

Tetracycline has broad antimicrobial capabilities in addition to a low pH, which can aid in the cleaning of implant surfaces. Inhibition of collagenase is also an effect of localized applied tetracycline. In a recent study by Samuelsson, Valnes and Wohlfahrt 24 patients were treated with a protocol consisting of debridement with a chitosan brush seated in an oscillating dental handpiece with adjunct H2O2 3% and tetracycline slurry. In 21 patients with 23 implants, reductions in both the CAL and mBoP(modified Bleeding on Probing) were observed between baseline and the reexaminations between nine months and up to 43 months.

Developing simple non surgical protocols for treatment of peri-implantitis will have a tremendous value for patients to avoid high expenses and morbidity by avoiding surgical intervention

Aim:

The aim of this prospective, randomized, parallel arm, blind clinical trial is to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes following non-surgical treatment of mild peri-implant defects using Labrida Bioclean with or without the application of tetracycline slurry.

Research Hypothesis:

The hypothesis is that the adjunctive application of tetracycline slurry will enhance the clinical and radiographic results of non-surgical treatment of mild peri-implant defects (defined as peri-implant bone loss 3-6 mm with pocket depths 6 mm or deeper, with mBI scores 2 or 3) with Labrida Bioclean. Probing pocket depth (PPD) reduction will be the primary outcome, whereas clinical attachment level (CAL), radiographic bone fill (RBF), recession depth (REC), modified bleeding index (mBI), presence of plaque (PL) , suppuration on probing (SUP) and MMP-8 levels on peri-implant sulcus fluid (PISF) will constitute the secondary outcome measures.

Study design:

The study will be a prospective, randomized, clinical trial of 6 months duration.

Treatment allocation:

Patients will be allocated either to test (BioClean with tetracycline slurry) or control (BioClean alone) treatment by computer-generated block randomization to ensure equal sample sizes. A software (www.randomizer.org) will be used by one of the investigators who will not participate in the clinical and radiographic measurements nor the therapeutic intervention, to generate a block randomization. Thus, participants will be randomized in one of the two groups. In patients with more than one implant meeting the inclusion criteria, a second randomization scheme with the same software will take place, to determine which will be included. The randomization results will be placed in sealed envelopes accessible only to the principal investigator and opened for each patient after the end of debridement with Labrida Bioclean to determine if tetracycline slurry will be applied or not Study setting Patient screening, inclusions and all clinical examinations will be performed by a board-certified specialist in periodontology or by a post-graduate student of the department of Preventive Dentistry, Periodontology \& Implant Biology. Treatments will be performed by a board-certified specialist in periodontology or by a post-graduate student of the department of Preventive Dentistry, Periodontology \& Implant Biology.

Patients:

40 patients (20+20) diagnosed with mild peri-implantitis, defined as peri-implant bone loss 3 -6 mm (minimum 3 mm and maximum 6 mm) with PPD 6 mm or deeper with mBI scores 2 or 3, will be included.

Recruitment of patients:

Patients referred to the specialist clinic in periodontology, will be screened for inclusion.

Procedure:

Before initiation of the study, the protocol will be approved by the Ethics Committee of the Dental School of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. In addition, informed consent will be signed by all participants.

Prior to inclusion in the study, an initial examination will be performed, including medical history, full- mouth plaque and bleeding scores, and PPDs, CALs, RECs, SUP, mBI, PL at 6 points on each implant. In addition, oral hygiene instructions and motivation will be given. Patients will receive a supragingival debridement with ultrasonic instruments, in one session, without local anesthesia. Commercially available and specific for implant debridement titanium curettes will be used to remove any supramucosal calculus in both groups prior to test or control treatments. Patients diagnosed with periodontal disease should be in the state of reminiscence after finished and re-evaluated active periodontal therapy. Endodontic lesions and dental decay should be treated prior to study start. Plaque Index (dichotomous scoring) should be below 20%. Before the treatment PISF sample will be collected for evaluation of MMP-8 levels with ELISA.

Active comparator group: Debridement with Labrida Bioclean Experimental group: Debridement with Labrida Bioclean and irrigation with tetracycline slurry

Treatment procedures:

Active comparator group: The implant pockets will be debrided with the Labrida BioClean biodegradable brush for 2 minutes and with the brush seated in an oscillating dental handpiece (NSK ESQ10 TEQ) and thereafter irrigated with sterile saline. The treatment will be repeated every three months. Debridement is performed with local anaesthesia as needed.

Experimental group: The implant pockets will be debrided with the BioClean biodegradable brush for 2 minutes and with the brush seated in an oscillating dental handpiece (NSK ESQ10 TEQ) and thereafter irrigated two minutes with tetracycline-hydrochloride (Arco Interpharma AS, Hokksund, Norway) in sterile saline with a concentration of 150 mg/ml, as chemical detergent adjunct to the chitosan brush. The treatment will be repeated every three months. Debridement is performed with local anaesthesia as needed.

At the end of the treatment procedure patients will be given oral hygiene instructions and specifically patients of the experimental group will be instructed to refrain from oral hygiene for 24 hours before initiating oral hygiene. 1 month after therapy patients will be re-evaluated as means of PPD, CAL, REC, mBI, PL, SUP measurements and levels of MMP-8 on PISF. 3 months after therapy will be re-evaluated for second time as in the 1 month re-evaluation. Furthermore, treatment will be repeated as it was randomized on baseline. On 6 month re-evaluation PPD, CAL, REC, mBI, PL, SUP measurements will be made and also a periapical x-ray will be taken to compare the peri-implant bone level with the respective bone level on the x-ray of the baseline.

All patients in the intervention group received rapid HIV antibody testing, CD4 cell testing, clinically relevant testing for opportunistic infections, WHO staging, comprehensive counseling and social support, and ART initiation on the day of presentation. The standard group received the same services as the same-day ART group (including CD4 cell testing) except that instead of same-day ART, they received the standard GHESKIO protocol of three sequential visits for ART readiness counseling and testing for opportunistic infections prior to ART initiation. For the same-day ART group, these activities took place on the day of ART initiation and during the subsequent two weeks. Three specific aims are proposed. The first aim is to compare the proportion of patients in the standard and same-day ART groups that are alive and in-care with an undetectable HIV viral load at 12 months after HIV testing. The second aim is to compare six-month ART adherence between the two groups using pharmacy refill records. The third aim is to compare the cost and cost-effectiveness of standard and same-day ART, where cost is measured by the mean treatment cost and effectiveness is measured by being alive and in care with an undetectable viral load at 12 months after HIV testing.

1\. To assess the prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-response (50% decline) to Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT) in men with ""intermediate and good-risk"" Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC).

Secondary Objectives:

1. To assess the objective response and time-to-progression with TRT in CRPC.
2. To assess serial changes in quality of life with TRT in these CRPC subsets.
3. Translational: To study kinetics of circulating tumor cells with TRT and molecular correlates of response to TRT in CRPC.","Generally, castration therapy has been used indefinitely for prostate cancer patients because some tumors seem to grow faster with testosterone present. Researchers want to study the effect of testosterone only in patients whose tumors have had a maximum response to castration therapy. Researchers want to find out if these patients' disease may be better controlled with testosterone replacement therapy.

Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have ""screening tests."" These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. Your complete medical history will be recorded and there will be a review of all medicines you may be currently taking. You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate). You will have blood drawn (about 4 teaspoons) and urine collected for routine tests. You will have a chest x-ray, an electrocardiogram (ECG--a test to measure the electrical activity of the heart), a bone scan, and a computed tomography (CT) scan of your abdomen and pelvis. If the study doctor thinks it is necessary, you may have an assessment of your mental status. For this assessment, you will be asked questions about your attention span, memory, and mood disturbances. It will take about 25 minutes to complete.

If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will begin receiving testosterone enanthate replacement therapy every 2 weeks by an injection into a muscle.

Every 2 weeks, you will go to the clinic for your testosterone injection, and blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check the testosterone level in your blood. This will help the study doctor learn what dose you will receive for the next 2 weeks. After your Week 8 visit, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to check the testosterone level in your blood every 4 weeks for the rest of your time on this study.

At the Week 8 and 24 visits, you will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs. You will be asked about any side effects you may be experiencing. Your disease status will be evaluated to learn its response to treatment. Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, and you will have repeat imaging scans (like the ones you had at your screening visit) to evaluate your disease. If the study doctor thinks that your mental status should be assessed again, you will have another assessment (at or around Week 24) like the one completed during your screening visit.

You may remain on this study indefinitely unless your disease gets worse or you experience any intolerable side effects.

If your participation ends on this study for any of the above reasons, you will have an end-of-study visit. During this visit, you will have blood drawn (about 4 teaspoons) for routine testing. You will be asked about any side effects you may be experiencing, and your disease response to treatment will be evaluated.

To improve the chance that melanoma will not recurr, new experimental combinations of a type of treatment called immunotherapy will be given before surgery.","This clinical trial is for patients with cutaneous melanoma which has spread to the lymph nodes (known as stage 3 melanoma) and for patients with any stage of mucosal melanoma. The study is for those patients who have disease that can be surgically removed.

The standard treatment for these patients is surgery to remove the affected tumour, lymph nodes, and any other deposits of melanoma, followed by drug therapy (known as adjuvant therapy). The most common drug therapy used to treat melanoma after surgery is known as 'immunotherapy'. Immunotherapy works by boosting the body's own immune system to better recognise and kill cancer cells.

The aim of the study is to offer new immunotherapy combinations to 3 cohorts of patients who are known to be poor responders to standard immunotherapy regimens.

Three cohorts of patients will be included:

1. Patients with resectable stage 3 cutaneous melanoma who have a predictive biomarker test result that indicates:

   Cohort 1a - they will be poor responders to standard anti-PD-1 immunotherapy (n=168) Cohort 1b - they will be high responders to standard anti-PD-1 immunotherapy (n=\~154)
2. Patients with resectable stage 3 cutaneous melanoma who have had a recurrence of melanoma despite having standard anti-PD-1 based immunotherapy (n=111).
3. Patients with resectable mucosal melanoma, at any stage of disease. Mucosal melanoma is known to respond poorly to stabdard immunotherapy (n=60).

This research will test 6 combinations of immunotherapy which are given before surgery. Treatment given before surgery is known as 'neoadjuvant' treatment. Neoadjuvant treatment is standard for many cancers, including melanoma. The purpose of neoadjuvant immunotherapy is to increase the body's natural immune response by training it to recognise the evasive cancer cells before they are removed at surgery, and to shrink or destroy the melanoma, which may make surgery easier. This has been shown to reduce the chance of melanoma recurring after surgery. The drugs used in this study are called 'nivolumab', 'relatlimab', and 'ipilimumab' and 'pembrolizumab'

In this trial, there are 5 different study treatment combinations. Each combination uses different mechanisms to potentially overcome the predicted resistance to standard immunotherapy. There are 4 phases to the study:

1. Neoadjuvant treatment with one of the new immunotherapy combinations
2. Surgery
3. Adjuvant treatment with standard immunotherapy, IF the neoadjuvant therapy has not been effective enough to clear more than 10% of cancer cells.
4. Follow up for recurrence and survival to the end of 10 years

The main goal is to learn which of the new immunotherapy combinations are most effective at destroying the melanoma cells before surgery for each cohort of patients.

The other important goals are to learn which treatment is best at preventing the return of melanoma over 10 years and which increases survival from melanoma. The investigators also want to evaluate the side effects patients may have to treatment and how this affects the quality of life. The investigators will also continue to research biomarkers in blood, tumour tissue and stools to identify possible mechanisms for better response to therapy.

When such perforations do not heal on their own, surgery called tympanoplasty is performed to repair the eardrum and improve hearing.

There are different surgical techniques for tympanoplasty. In the underlay technique, the graft (a small piece of tissue used to repair the hole) is placed beneath the layers of the eardrum. This approach is simpler and commonly used, but it carries risks such as displacement of the graft. In the interlay technique, the graft is positioned between specific layers of the eardrum, which may allow more natural healing and better hearing results, but it is technically more demanding.

This clinical study will compare the postoperative outcomes of these two techniques-interlay and underlay-among adults with large central perforations of the eardrum caused by chronic otitis media.

According to Lancet data, in 2017, there were 48.9 million cases of sepsis worldwide, resulting in approximately 11 million deaths, accounting for 19.7% of the total global deaths. Surviving sepsis patients often experience secondary infections and chronic organ dysfunction, which affects their long-term quality of life and poses a huge socio-economic burden. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified sepsis as a global health priority and called for improving the level of sepsis prevention and treatment. With the advancement of medical technology, the diagnostic and treatment guidelines for sepsis are constantly updated, and clinical treatment capabilities have been improved. However, sepsis remains the main threat to global health. Due to the high heterogeneity, the diagnosis of sepsis is difficult, and it is particularly important to find biomarkers that can predict changes in the patient's condition and prognosis. The purpose of this study is to collect patient blood samples for testing and identify biomarkers related to the prognosis of sepsis.",Qilu Hospital of Shandong University,OTHER,SPONSOR,OBSERVATIONAL,False,ESTIMATED,1000.0,,,,,COHORT,PROSPECTIVE,,SAMPLES_WITH_DNA,5ml blood from sepsis patients,"Inclusion Criteria:

The research will be conducted with 90 people (45 experimental, 45 control group) who meet the sample criteria between October 30, 2024 and July 30, 2025. The experimental group will be given breastfeeding training accompanied by motivational interviews, and the control group will not receive any intervention.","Breastfeeding is the healthiest and most effective way for the unique nutrient breast milk to reach the baby. Breastfeeding has many physiological, psychological, social, emotional, societal and economic benefits. Women's inexperience in breastfeeding, the weak value they attribute to breastfeeding, lack of social support systems, and breastfeeding problems they experience can be obstacles to successful breastfeeding. Breastfeeding problems experienced during the lactation process lead to a feeling of exhaustion and inadequacy in the mother and cause mothers to stop breastfeeding. The most common factors that negatively affect breastfeeding are; nipple trauma, breast pain, breast fullness, mastitis, excessive or low breast milk production, difficulty in placing the baby at the breast, breast refusal in the baby, the mother and/or the baby being sick and using medication as a result, fatigue and exhaustion in the mother. Along with these problems, the mother's return to work life is also among the factors that negatively affect breastfeeding. Breastfeeding education and counseling programs are effective in initiating and continuing breastfeeding, solving breastfeeding problems, increasing self-sufficiency, and increasing breastfeeding rates. Nurses, who are important building blocks of the health team, provide support to mothers from the prenatal period to the postnatal period by using their roles as caregivers, decision-makers, patient rights advocates, educators, and consultants. Today, thanks to the development of technology and easy access, traditionally applied trainings have been replaced by trainings provided with newer, modern, visual technologies. These can be listed as peer education, telephone counseling, online and web-based counseling, teach-back, home visits, and model use. Studies have reported that health education programs based on the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills Model have a positive effect on individuals' health practices, increase self-sufficiency, and contribute to the development of positive behaviors in individuals. In recent years, motivational interviewing techniques have also been frequently encountered in nursing practices. With the motivational interviewing technique applied during the breastfeeding process, mothers' individual preferences are valued, their indecisiveness is resolved, and their self-sufficiency is supported. In this context, this study aimed to examine the effect of motivational interviews based on the Knowledge, Motivation, Behavioral Skills Model on breastfeeding. The randomized controlled experimental study will be conducted with 90 people (45 experimental, 45 control group) who meet the sampling criteria between October 30, 2024 and July 30, 2025. 4 sessions of motivational interviewing will be applied to the experimental group, and no intervention will be made to the control group.

But there is no consensus regarding the efficacy of PEG alone vs lactulose combined with isabgol used as stool softeners, frequently used for relieving acute constipation in an acute fissure in ano. Hence a good quality randomised study to compare both efficacies is the need of the hour.","Acute fissure in ano is a very common, painful and distressing benign anorectal disorder. It is a linear tear in the anoderm of the distal anal canal most commonly on the posterior midline. They usually result from trauma caused by the passage of hard stool and less commonly from diarrhoea also. The most common presenting symptom is anal pain, bleeding and secondary constipation. Most of the cases are managed conservatively by increasing oral fluid intake, high fibre diet, sitz bath, stool softeners and topical application of sphincter muscle relaxants.

Constipation is one of the most common causes of anal fissure. Patients present to the outpatient department due to acute anal pain resulting from increased internal anal sphincter tone with spasms and hard stool rubbing over the crack. Constipation and pain due to anal fissure are initially managed with lifestyle and dietary modifications like consuming adequate fluids, increased fibre diet and sitz bath.

One of the fibre supplements is isabgol husk, a soluble fibre with enormous water-absorbing properties. Its added benefits include properties like non-irritant to the large bowel, non-fermenting, and dichotomous stool normalising agents, making it one of the most preferred bulk-forming agents. Low cost and over the counter availability are other benefits. Lactulose is also the most commonly prescribed laxative used in acute anal fissures to relieve constipation. Polyethylene glycol is a common osmotic laxative used for the relief of constipation in the treatment of anal fissures.

There are multiple studies that say polyethylene glycol has better efficacy in terms of frequency of stools, and form of stools compared to lactulose or isabgol husk alone. However, there are no studies conducted to compare the efficacy of polyethylene glycol vs combined use of isabgol husk and lactulose in relief of constipation in an acute fissure in ano. However, studies prove that laxatives may reduce/delay the absorption of certain medications, hence medications are advised to be taken 1 hour before or 2-3 hours after taking laxatives.

Patients in both arms will be advised to use local lidocaine with nifedipine cream (Anobliss cream from Samarth Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd., India). One arm will be given polyethylene glycol syrup for 2 weeks maximum and in the other arm, isabgol husk plus lactulose will be given for 2 weeks.

It is unclear whether the relatively low number of reported cases of COVID-19 in people with CF (pwCF) is due to enhanced infection prevention practices or whether pwCF have protective genetic/immune factors. This study aims to prospectively assess the proportion of pwCF, including both adults and children with CF who have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies over a two-year period. This study will also examine whether pwCF who have antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 have a different clinical presentation and what impact this has on their CF disease. The proposed study will recruit pwCF from paediatric and adult CF centres in Europe. Serological testing to detect antibodies will be performed on blood samples taken at month 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 with additional time-points if bloodwork is available via normal clinical care. Clinical data on lung function, CF-related medical history, pulmonary exacerbations, antibiotic use, and microbiology and vaccination receipt, will be collected during routine clinical assessments.

Associations will be examined between socio-demographic and clinical variables and serologic testing. The effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on clinical outcomes and analyse end-points will be examined to explore any age-related or gender-based differences, as well as subgroup analysis of outcomes in lung-transplant recipients and pwCF receiving CFTR modulator therapies. As pwCF receive COVID-19 vaccination a comparison of the development and progression of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in pwCF following natural infection and vaccination SARS-CoV-2 over time will be performed.","This is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study in people with Cystic Fibrosis (pwCF) that involves repeated serial sampling of participants. This study design was chosen to provide comprehensive information on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence changes over time and the subsequent clinical impact on pwCF. The study will be conducted at participating CF centres over a 3-year period. Study participants will include paediatric and adult pwCF. Participating investigators can enrol all eligible pwCF over a 12-month period. Participants are then followed up for 24 months. Participants will donate blood samples at their routine clinic visits. Blood samples will be collected at Day 0 (baseline), at Months 6, 12, 18 and 24 (to coincide with routine clinical reviews). Additional blood samples will be taken opportunistically every time the participant visits the clinic for blood draws. These blood samples could be related to, routine care, annual review visits, pulmonary exacerbations (PEx), CF complications or when initiating new treatments (e.g. CFTR modulators).

Serum from blood samples will be shipped to a central laboratory (Queen's University Belfast) for standardized measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Alongside the blood samples the investigators will also collect clinical data from the patient's health records and will input this data into the case report form (CRF). Clinical data will be collected in conjunction with routine care visits, according to local clinical practice. Investigators will collect data elements from information routinely recorded in the patients' medical records. Data will be collected at baseline, month 6, 12, 18 and 24 as per the study schedule, and at additional blood sampling timepoints as previously explained above. Data collection will include routine data available from CF clinic follow-ups including background demographic information, CF medical history, medications, exacerbation information, sputum microbiology and clinical and lung function parameters. Information on SARS-CoV-2 infection history and vaccine receipt will also be collected.

The maximum follow-up duration of participation in the study for each patient will be 24 months. This study duration (24-month follow-up) is justified as it provides sufficient time to observe changes in antibody prevalence over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as sufficient time to determine long term clinical outcomes for pwCF who are SARS-CoV-2 seropositive. Furthermore, the investigators anticipate the 2-year study follow-up period will provide sufficient time to observe the impact of vaccination on antibody levels given that a number of vaccines are now commercially available.

The investigators will compare the level of antibody responses between natural COVID-19 infection and vaccination in pwCF and how this varies over time. This will be achieved by analyzing seroprevalence and antibody levels according to natural infection and vaccination status and according to time of sample post infection or post vaccination, if known.

Optional Study sample collection:

For participants who consent, a second blood sample will also be drawn into EDTA tubes (plasma).

The main factors investigated here are the image type of the visual stimulus (drawing or photographic image) and the response variety (standard language vs dialect). The hypothesis is formulated as follows: The image type of the visual stimulus (drawing or photographic image) and the response variety (standard language or dialect) will have an effect on naming correctness and/or naming latencies in people with aphasia within the picture naming test.

The experiment was as follows: Persons with aphasia and healthy participants were presented with objects and verbs depicted as photographs or illustrations on a tablet. All participants were asked to name the depicted term in two different language varieties as correctly and as fast as possible. Answers were recorded synchronously. No feedback should be given to the participants (=no therapy). The results of picture naming were not analyzed patient-specifically in relation to their condition or therapy. Naming performance was collected as a momentary data set in order to investigate the speed of naming in general.

The ethic committee Northwestern and Central Switzerland approved the study to be observational as no effect of intervention(s) on biomedical or other health related outcomes were evaluated, but only the influence of type of the visual stimulus and the response variety on correctness and naming latencies in the two participant groups.","Qulity assurance:

To verify the presence and reliability of all subject data, the following items were checked during these visits using a checklist: Presence of informed consent, presence of all data requested in the questionnaire, correctness of the data copied from the source files (e.g. test protocols) and traceability of the data flow. At the end of the experiment, the correct storage of the data (informed consent of the study participants, identification list, raw data) were checked. All involved staff who had access to the clinical data were informed and trained about anonymization, ethical aspects and correct data manipulation and storage. Direct access to the source data and all relevant documents and records is guaranteed to the ethics committee upon request and presentation.

Data dictionary:

* Questionnaire on personal and health-related information of the experiment participants: Frequencies, descriptive statistics
* The Pyramids and Palm Trees test (PPTT) (Howard \& Patterson 1992): passed/not passed: scores above 90% indicate correct cognitive semantics, scores below indicate impaired; 90% of the images must be correctly matched, i.e., at least 47 of 52 items.
* Colouring of Pictures test (CoPT) (De Renzi et al. 1972): passed/not passed: In order to exclude the presence of an acquired color diagnosis due to the brain injury suffered by participants with aphasia, the ability to assign colors to objects is tested with a coloration test.
* Picture Naming Test: Number of correct responses and naming latencies when picture stimuli are presented in two language varieties (Swiss dialect and Swiss standard language)

Data recording and source data:

Case Report Forms (CRF) were printed out on paper and given to experiment participants and practice partners to collect personal and health-related data. Personal and health-related source data was collected in hard copy in the CRF and hard copies were given to study participants and practice partners. Data from pretesting (PPTT, CoPT) for experiment participants with aphasia were recorded manually on the CRF, as were any comments about abnormalities during the course of the study. Data needed for analysis of naming correctness and naming latency (audio and, if consent is given, video data) were collected electronically. Data on naming correctness were also collected on the CRF. The qualitative question-guided interview at the conclusion of data collection was recorded electronically, with accompanying key words noted on the CRF.

AAT scores (from Aachener aphasia test scale) as well as other routinely collected data from patient records of participants with aphasia on the type of aphasia present was manually transferred to the CRF by the speech therapists of the collaborators. The CRFs in paper form are digitized by study staff by scanning and manually transferred to electronic data (filling in Excel lists).

Data protection and data security: confidentiality and encryption The collection, transmission, storage and analysis of health-related personal data of this experiment was carried out in accordance with Art. 5 of the HFV (Humanforschungsgesetz) and in strict compliance with Swiss legal data protection regulations. The project data was kept strictly confidential and was only accessible to authorized personnel who needed the data to fulfill their tasks within the research project. All staff were informed about data protection and confidentiality and were subject to the legal requirements. In the CRF and other project-specific documents, participants were only referred to by a unique identification code, which could only be reconstructed by the participants themselves, but which did not allow any conclusions to be drawn about the participants. The participant identification list as well as the signed informed consents were stored in a secure location at the collaborators and was only transferred to the FHNW after the end of the study, where they will be kept in a safe.

Participant data was collected using an application that was programmed for the experiment under the unique participant identification number only. Other relevant personal and health data was collected in paper form in the CRF. Audio recordings were made of study participants during the naming test and, with the consent of the study participants, they were also filmed; the image and audio sequence were stored in each case. The video recording data was only used for further research, education and training purposes with the prior consent of the experiment participants. All subject-related data was encrypted and stored on the tablet's SD card. The SD card was personally transported to the FHNW by the person conducting the study together with the CRF, where it was handed over to the study director. The information was then decrypted and analyzed on an FHNW computer. The decrypted data was stored securely on three external storage media. One was kept as a backup in the FHNW safe, and two others were used for data analysis at the Academy of Art and Design FHNW and at the School of Education FHNW. These external hard drives were kept securely in safes at the respective institutes when not in use. No original data was stored directly on the FHNW computers. Only the results of the data analysis were stored on other personal computers or secured internal servers. The encryption was managed by the project management. Only a few authorized persons know the key. A list is kept of these persons.

Storage of data:

Data obtained from the research project (raw data sets, analysis results, and anonymized documents) will be archived for at least ten years, protected from access, to ensure scientific sustainability. One hard drive is kept in the FHNW safe, one in appropriately secure locations at the IVK (HGK) and ISP (PH) institutes of the FHNW. Only authorized persons have access. Participant identification lists are destroyed. Should the data be destroyed after a minimum of ten years, all electronic data is deleted and the storage area is securely overwritten. Paper sheets such as the CRF are rendered unusable with the file shredder.

Sample size assessment:

Determining the sample size: The power analysis is based on a simulation. A baseline accuracy (e.g., the percentage correct on stimulus type 1, variety 1) for each of the n virtual participants was first defined.A certain effect size for each of the two factors, stimulus and variety was defined. Both factors are assumed to have an effect as large as an odds ratio of 1.3. This size of odds ratio was used to define the odds for each participant and thus the precision in the other cells of the design. Both effects are analyzed for each simulated data set and then analyzed using a generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM) with a binomial distribution of outcomes and a random intercept per participant. Power is calculated as the proportion of simulations for which this statistical model detects an effect of both stimulus type and response variety.

Plan for missing data:

Only those data sets in which participants have completed at least two cells of the design (stimulus type x response variety) are included in the analysis. To counteract dropout of experiment participants - caused by withdrawal of experiment participants, by technical problems in data collection, or by insufficiently collected data - more participants are preemptively recruited than statistically necessary (40 instead of 36 subjects per group) to ensure that there will be enough data to represent an effect, should there be one.

Statistical analysis:

The macula is the part of the retina in the back of the eye that determines central or best vision. AMD can severely impair central vision, affecting a person's ability to read, drive, and carry out daily activities. This vision loss is caused by the formation of abnormal new blood vessels in the choroid-a thin, pigmented vascular layer of the eye behind the retina-that leak blood under the macula. PTD stops the growth of these blood vessels and slows the rate of vision loss. However, the treatment usually does not cause vision to improve, and it has only a temporary effect, requiring several treatments over 2 years. Furthermore, PDT does not work in all patients and may actually cause some swelling and re-growth of blood vessels. Celecoxib is an anti-inflammatory drug that, in animal studies, has prevented the growth of abnormal blood vessels associated with tumors and with injury to the cornea. Thus, the drug might reduce swelling and prevent vessel re-growth in AMD, enhancing the effectiveness of PDT.

Patients 55 years of age and older with AMD and visual acuity of 20/20 to 20/200 may be eligible for this study. Participants will be randomly assigned to take either celecoxib or a placebo (a look-alike pill with no active drug) twice a day and undergo the various tests and procedures detailed below. Not every examination will be done at every visit, but all may be required at one visit.

* Medical history and physical examination
* Blood drawing: A blood sample is drawn from an arm vein to evaluate liver and kidney function
* Eye examination: Visual acuity and eye pressure are measured, and the lens, retina, pupils and eye movements are examined
* Photography: Photographs of the eye are taken using a special camera with a bright flash
* Fluorescein angiography: Pictures of the retina are taken to look for abnormal blood vessels. A yellow dye is injected into an arm vein and travels to the blood vessels in the eyes. The retina is photographed using a camera that flashes a blue light into the eye. The pictures show if any dye has leaked from the vessels into the retina, indicating possible blood vessel abnormality.
* Indocyanine green angiography: This procedure, similar to fluorescein angiography, uses a green dye to photograph the retina and identify portions of abnormal vessels in the deepest part of the retina.
* Optical coherence tomography: This new technique uses light to produce a 2-dimensional cross-sectional picture of the retina. The patient looks into a machine called an optical coherence tomograph at a pattern of flashing and rotating red and green lights, first with one eye and then the other.

One week after starting the study medications, laser treatment will begin. For this procedure, a needle is placed in an arm vein and a chemical called verteporfin (Visudyne® (Registered Trademark)) is infused into the vein over 10 minutes. After 15 minutes, the eye is anesthetized with numbing drops. A special contact lens is then placed on the eye and the laser beam is directed to the eye for 83 seconds.

Patients will be followed in the clinic every 6 weeks for 36 weeks for various examinations and possible re-treatment, if needed. Some patients will be asked to return 1 to 2 weeks after the first PDT for an eye examination and fluorescein angiography.","Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) represents the most common cause of blindness in patients over the age of 60. The major cause of vision loss in this disease is due to the development of choroidal neovascularization. Several clinical trials have shown that eyes with predominately 'well-defined' areas of neovascularization (lesions having at least 50% of vessels which can be readily demarcated with fluorescein angiography) can benefit from treatment with photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, this treatment benefit only results in a reduction in the number of patients who suffer severe vision loss. Few patients demonstrate an improvement in visual acuity. In addition, other neovascular lesions such as those with predominate occult (vessels that are difficult to outline by fluorescein angiography) or pure occult do not demonstrate any substantial treatment benefit.

Histopathologic studies have demonstrated the presence of an inflammatory response in the retina of patients with choroidal neovascularization as well as in eyes receiving PDT. In addition, in eyes receiving PDT, a vascular remodeling and continued neovascular process occurs. Therefore, the use of celecoxib (Celebrex® (Registered Trademark)), a specific cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, which possesses both anti-angiogenic as well as anti-inflammatory properties, may be beneficial in patients with neovascular AMD undergoing PDT.

The study will be organized as a double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled, prospective multi-center clinical trial to investigate the ability of celecoxib to alter the inflammatory and neovascular responses in AMD patients undergoing PDT. The results of this study will contribute to the design of a larger definitive clinical trial. The primary outcome measure is a drop of 15 letters or more in best corrected visual acuity following initial PDT treatment at 1 year. The secondary outcome measures are stabilization (drop of 4 letters of less from baseline) or improvement of best corrected visual acuity following initial PDT treatment at week 36, and an improvement by 5 or more letters in visual acuity from baseline to week 36, time to retreatment with PDT, number of retreatments with PDT and a change in the CNV size, the extent of leakage and staining detected by fluorescein angiography. Additional outcome measures will be the change in size and extent of vascular remodeling and choroidal new vessel formation as determined by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and high-speed indocyanine green angiography (HS-ICG).",National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),NIH,,INTERVENTIONAL,,,60.0,,,,TREATMENT,,,,,,"INCLUSION CRITERIA:

52cf3d110262e797,NCT05356780,Predictability of Orthodontic Tooth Movement With Invisalign Aligners,Predictability of Orthodontic Tooth Movement With Invisalign Aligners: Effect of Treatment Design and Operator Experience,,157/2020,"Together with the increased adult patient demand for orthodontic treatment and the push toward increasingly personalized treatment, technology developments have resulted in a growing worldwide demand for clear aligners, to the point that they are now an essential part of any orthodontic practice.

Despite the widespread use of the technique, the existing literature about reliability of orthodontic tooth movement with Invisalign aligners seems not encouraging. Several papers have demonstrated that what is virtually planned is not what is clinically achievable. However, it should be considered that clear aligner orthodontics techniques are customized not only for the patients but for orthodontists too. Therefore, virtual treatment plan design, in terms of attachments' design and placement, orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) staging and aligner deformation overengineering, or in other words aligners biomechanics knowledge, plays a crucial role in defining the quality of the orthodontic treatment with Invisalign aligners.

Based on these considerations the present study was designed to answer two research-clinical questions: 1) which are the less predictable orthodontic movements with Invisalign aligners when the treatment plan is designed by expert operators? and 2) which is the impact of the orthodontist experience, in terms of patient motivation, on the predictability of orthodontic tooth movement with Invisalign aligners? To answer those questions, the predictability of OTM in a sample of Invisalign patients treated by expert operators was compared with the predictability of OTM in a sample treated by post-graduate students.

The null hypothesis for question 1 is that all the prescribed orthodontic tooth movements are predictable, while the null hypothesis for question 2 is that the reliability of orthodontic tooth movement is not affected by operator experience.

98 patients (31 M, 67 F; mean age 28 ± 12 years) were selected among those in treatment at the Department of Orthodontics of the University of Turin, which is the coordinating center, and at 5 private orthodontics offices across Italy. The inclusion criteria for practitioners were as follows: orthodontist with huge and renewed experience in Invisalign treatments; has the ability to scan plaster model or to collect intraoral scans and upload (via internet) the files obtained to a central repository; affirms that the practice can devote sufficient time in patient scheduling to allow focused recording of all data required for the study; and does not anticipate retiring, selling the practice, or moving during the study. Signed, written informed consent was required before inclusion in the trial.

All participants included in this prospective observational study had Class I or mild Class II malocclusion with mild to moderate crowding or spacing in the maxillary and mandibular dental arches (nonextraction cases). Interproximal enamel reduction was performed as prescribed in each patient's virtual treatment plan.

The average treatment time was 10 ± 5 months. The sample considered a total of 2716 teeth that were analyzed overlapping the real post-treatment .stl file obtained with the final intra-oral scan to the planned post-treatment .stl file obtained exporting the final stage of the virtual setup.

Every virtual treatment plan was designed by orthodontists with a huge and renewed experience in Invisalign treatments. While in the private practices the treatment was directly conducted by 5 expert orthodontist (mean age 45.6 ± 8.2) who controlled the patient at every appointment, in the University setting the treatment was conducted by 5 post-graduate students at the last year of their program (mean age 26.4± 1.4). Control appointments were fixed at 6 weeks interval in both the University and the private settings.

Posttreatment digital models and final virtual treatment plan models were exported from ClinCheck® software as stereolithography files and subsequently imported into Geomagic Qualify software (3D Systems(r), Rock Hill, South Carolina, USA), in order to compare individual tooth positions between digital models of each patient. The dental arches were superimposed using the landmark-based method and the surface-based method (Best Fit Alignment). So that the differences between the tooth positions could be calculated, 3 reference planes were identified on the virtual treatment plan model. Differences between the actual treatment outcome and the predicted outcome were calculated and tested for statistical significance for each tooth in the mesial-distal, vestibular-lingual, and occlusal-gingival directions, as well as for angulation, inclination, and rotation. Differences greater than 0.5 mm for linear measurements and 2° for angular measurements were considered clinically significant. In addition, the statistical significance of categorical variables was tested for each previously calculated difference in tooth movement.",,"University of Turin, Italy",OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,OBSERVATIONAL,False,ACTUAL,98.0,,,,,COHORT,PROSPECTIVE,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Acute kidney injury (AKI) following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is a major complication occurring in 1% to 53% of patients (depending on how it is defined) with the pooled rate of 18.2% and unfortunately 2.1% of them require renal replacement therapy. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)-associated AKI increases mortality 2-4 fold regardless of AKI definition. It is also associated with increased risk of postoperative stroke, acute myocardial infarction, cardiac tamponade, heart failure, and lengthened intensive care unit and hospital stays. Even minor elevations of postoperative serum creatinine (SCr) have been associated with a significant increase in 30-day mortality, from a 3-fold increase risk for a small elevation of up to 0.5 mg/dL from baseline to an 18-fold increase risk of death with a SCr rise greater than 0.5 mg/dL.

The pathogenesis of CPB-associated AKI is complicated and includes hemodynamic, inflammatory and other mechanisms that interact at a cellular level. To date, despite several clinical trials of pharmacologic interventions, none of them have demonstrated conclusively efficacy in the prevention of AKI after cardiac surgery.

Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a phenomenon in which brief ischemia of one organ or tissue, provokes a protective effect that can reduce the mass of infarction caused by vessel occlusion and reperfusion. In CABG surgery, cardiomyocyte injury caused by myocardial protection failure is predominantly responsible for adverse outcomes. RIPC was shown to reduce troponin release 24 h postoperatively in children undergoing corrective surgery for congenital heart disease. Other studies demonstrated that RIPC using brief ischemia and reperfusion of the upper limb reduces myocardial injury in adult patients undergoing CABG surgery.

Due to the similarities between the mechanisms of ischemia-reperfusion injury produced by RIPC and those proposed for AKI after CPB, we decided to test the hypothesis that RIPC prevents AKI in patients undergoing CABG surgery.

Methods:

180 patients who fulfill all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be divided into case and control groups (90 patients in the case and 90 patients in the control group).

Patients in the treatment group will receive three sequential sphygmomanometer cuff inflations on their right upper arm after induction of anesthesia in the operating room. The cuff will be inflated by the OR nurse up to 200 mmHg for five minutes each occasion, with five minutes deflation in between inflations. Following this pre-conditioning phase, surgery will be started. The entire pre-conditioning phase will last 30 minutes.

Patients in the control group will have the sphygmomanometer cuff placed on their right upper arm, but the cuff will not be inflated. Similar to patients in the treatment group, patients in the control group will undergo the same 30 minute delay before starting surgery.

Complete blood count (CBC), SCr, liver function test (LFT), will be checked before surgery.

After surgery, SCr will be checked daily. If AKI occurs, it will be managed and dialysis will be done if the patient requires it. All patients will undergo electrocardiogram and LFT after CABG surgery during hospital course.",,Shiraz University of Medical Sciences,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,180.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,PREVENTION,,,QUADRUPLE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Due to the size of some cysts, they may cause discomfort. Moreover, a genuine risk of ovarian torsion presents when these lesions grow.

During the last decades, great advancements have been made in the correct differentiation of benign from malignant lesions. However, there still is controversy concerning the optimal treatment approach of symptomatic adnexal cysts with a low risk of malignancy, consisting of both surgery or ultrasound-guided transvaginal aspiration. Factors such as comorbidities and lesion characteristics need to be considered when counselling patients, as well as the possibility of short term recurrence.

Surgically removing them may result in longer hospital stays and recovery, with higher costs, while transvaginal needle aspiration techniques can be performed during a consultation. Additional benefits in avoiding surgery, particularly in women of reproductive age, are fertility preservation and less pelvic adhesions.

On the other hand, the main arguments against cyst aspiration are the relatively high recurrence rate of cysts, the minimal risk of malignant cell dissemination (In case of a false negative diagnosis) and the cytological instead of a histopathological examination.

With this in mind, it is important to base management decisions on the sonographic features of the lesions.

In addition, cyst aspiration can also be considered in large symptomatic cysts with a high risk of malignancy, but where curative treatment with surgical or chemotherapeutical intervention cannot be considered due to poor general condition of the patient. Especially in the absence of large volume ascites or peritoneal carcinomatosis, but with significant symptoms due to lesion size, cyst aspiration may give short term symptom alleviation. Given the risk of cancer cell dissemination, this intervention is always discussed in a multidisciplinary team discussion, to balance risk and benefits for patients with no other treatment options, Transvaginal needle aspiration is also being used in pelvic abscesses. The study of K. Gjelland et al. found that transvaginal aspiration combined with antibiotic treatment of pelvic abscesses is equally effective as surgically removing them. They state that this should be first-line treatment for abscesses, as it is minimally invasive, leading to better patient tolerance and avoiding the risks associated with anesthesia and surgery.

Saline irrigation of the abscess cavity can be performed, making the process of pus aspiration easier when the consistency is too viscous.

The literature still lacks studies about the symptom relief in patients receiving treatment for pelvic cystic lesions. Given that this is an important outcome parameter in determining the feasibility of performing procedures, more research in this area is needed.

The main aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the patient's symptom relief and cyst recurrence rate after ultrasound-guided transvaginal aspiration of pelvic cystic lesions or abscess drainage.

The growth and dissemination of self-medication practice represents a serious global public health issue, with increased risks of adverse drug reactions, non-beneficial drug interactions, drug abuse, and the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens.

Parents are the primary caregivers to whom children report their symptoms. But due to the presence of economic and time constraints, some parents seek the practice of self-medication for their children .

\- Innate immunity is the process by which white blood cells and other parts of the immune system sense and respond to potential infections by causing an inflammation. Researchers are interested in studying how the body responds to certain environmental factors, and whether the body s response can contribute to chronic illnesses or diseases such as asthma and certain types of cancers.

Objectives:

\- To examine how specific genes and proteins in blood cells respond to environmental exposures.

Eligibility:

\- Healthy volunteers between 18 and 45 years of age.

Design:

* The study will involve one visit of 45 to 60 minutes.
* Participants will be screened with a brief physical examination and finger stick to determine if they are eligible to donate blood for the study, and will complete a questionnaire about any medications or other drugs (e.g., cigarettes) they may be taking.
* Participants will provide a blood sample for research purposes.","This research study will examine the role of innate immunity on the Inflammatory response of monocytes and macrophages to endotoxin. Approximately 1450 healthy participants aged 18 years and older will be identified and recruited from the Environmental Polymorphism Registry (EPR). The EPR is a long-term project to collect and store up to 15,000 DNA samples for use in research studies from individuals in the greater North Carolina Triangle Region. It is anticipated that approximately 50% of the participants contacted will enroll and about 15% of participants enrolled will withdraw.

This controlled, observational gene association study will recruit participants on the basis of genotype and then observe the phenotype of each participant. There are several SNPs of interest in the genes TIRAP, MyD88, ABCA1, CD14, CD44, ITIH3, ITIH4, TLR4, TNFa, TLR5, IRGM, and APOL1. In addition there are alleles of interest in the gene ApoE. These alleles taken together are considered a polymorphism. For each polymorphism of interest a separate group of participants will be recruited (including heterozygous and homozygous for both the minor and major alleles for each SNP). A maximum of 200 mLs of blood will be obtained from each participant during one visit lasting approximately 1-1.5 hours. Blood monocytes will be isolated from the donated blood samples and cultured to obtain macrophages. The macrophages will be exposed ex vivo to an endotoxin (LPS) and to PAM3CSK4 to determine cell response depending on genotype. In studies of APOL1, a urine specimen will also be collected to evaluate for protein filtration.

The primary objective is to determine associations between select polymorphisms in genes \[TIRAP (TIR Associated Protein), MyD88 (Myeloid Differentiation Primary Response Protein 88), ApoE (Apolipoprotein E), ABCA1 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter A1), CD14, CD44, ITIH3, ITIH4, TLR4, TNFa, TLR5, IRGM, and APOL1\] and quantitative in vitro inflammatory functions of two cell types, the macrophage and neutrophil. The primary endpoints of this study for both cell types will be levels of 6 cytokines TNF alpha, IL-6, MIP-2, IL-8, MCP-1, and IFN-beta (ELISA) induced by LPS and by PAM3CSK4 plus baseline cytokine levels (no exposure to LPS or PAM3CSK4). Urinary levels of protein will be quantified in some studies as a measure of early kidney dysfunction.

We hope the results of this study may lead to discovery of important information regarding the role of MDC1 (Mediator of DNA damage Checkpoint protein 1) in human disease, potentially identifying new targets for future studies.",National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),NIH,SPONSOR,OBSERVATIONAL,,ESTIMATED,725.0,,,,,COHORT,CROSS_SECTIONAL,,,,"* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

Cold application is a non-invasive, non-pharmacological, cost-effective and effort-effective therapy for pain management. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether colding of ETT can reduce sore throat, dysphagia and dysphonia after endotracheal intubation.","The incidence of postoperative sore throat (POST) has been reported up to 62% following general anaesthesia.It is an undesirable events experienced by patients after general anaesthesia. Various pharmacological agents have been applied to reduce POST, such as lidocaine, ketamine, magnesium, corticosteroids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. However, these agents may have some systemic and local side effects. Therefore, various non-pharmacological applications have been investigated to reduce sore throat. Cold application is a non-invasive, cost-effective and effort-effective therapy for pain management. Although the mechanism is not clearly known, it increases the pain threshold, slows cellular metabolism, causes vasoconstriction, and reduces capillary permeability. Therefore, we hypothesized that colding of endotracheal tube may decrease POST associated with airway inflammation. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether colding of ETT can reduce sore throat, dysphagia and dysphonia after endotracheal intubation. The goal of this study is to identify a simple, safe, and inexpensive perioperative intervention to reduce post operative sore throat.

The enhanced technology intervention will combine mobile contingency management (mCM), guideline-based smoking cessation counseling, bupropion and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and use of the Stay Quit Coach. For this study, we will propose a clinical trial with a two-group design in which 20 smokers with PTSD will be randomized to either:

Specific aims are to:

AIM 1: evaluate the efficacy of QUIT4EVER on rates of abstinence from cigarettes (assessed with multiple measures including bioverified abstinence) during short and long term abstinence (measured at 3 and 6 months).

Hypothesis 1: QUIT4EVER will be associated with increased long term abstinence (self-reported and bio-verified prolonged abstinence at the 3 and 6 month follow-up).

AIM 2: assess the impact of QUIT4EVER on counseling treatment completion and medication adherence.

Hypothesis 2. Increased abstinence associated with QUIT4EVER will be partially mediated by increased telephone counseling treatment completion and greater medication adherence.

AIM 3: calculate the relative cost-effectiveness of the QUIT4EVER intervention in quality adjusted life years (QALY).

Hypothesis 3: QUIT4EVER based treatment will result in greater cost-effectiveness compared to the control condition as measured by the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio.

Over 80% of the patients reported adherence to the skin care recommendations which included application of a thin layer of Essex® cream, a non-perfumed aqueous cream, on the irradiated area at least two times a day (Sharp et al., 2011). The effects of skin care products containing Calendula Officinalis (marigold plant) on ARSR in patients with breast cancer were investigated in a randomized clinical trial (Pommier et al., 2004). Patients in the experimental group, treated with calendula cream had a statistically significant lower incidence of severe ARSR, pain and treatment interruptions in comparison with the patients in the control group, treated with trolamine.

The purpose of this blinded, randomized clinical trial is to compare two topical agents, Calendula Weleda® cream and Essex® cream, in terms of efficacy to reduce the risk of severe acute radiation skin reactions (ARSR) in relation to adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) for breast cancer.

Patients were instructed to apply a thin layer of the assigned cream twice a day, starting at the onset of RT and continue until two weeks after termination, or until the ARSR is healed. The application should include the whole treatment area including the armpit and shoulder/back area in patients treated with modified radical mastectomy. Patients are also advised to not apply the cream within two hours before the RT in order to avoid possible build-up effect. Daily wash with perfume free soap and tap water are recommended and patients are advised to refrain from use of other topical agents in the irradiated area.

The primary endpoint is the efficacy to reduce acute radiation skin reactions (ARSR), assessed with the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/The Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (RTOG/EORTC scale) at follow-up.

Secondary endpoints include patient reported outcome measures; Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30), Sleep disturbances (MOS-sleep questionnaire) and symptoms experienced from the irradiated area (visual analogue scale). Patients' experiences and adherence to the topical agents are also evaluated.

A total of 400 patients are required to detect a true absolute reduction in the proportion of patients with ARSR, from 35% with standard treatment (Essex® cream) to 20% with the experimental treatment (Calendula Weleda® cream), with a significance level of 5% a power of 90%. With this sample size, 95% confidence intervals for the difference in proportions are estimated to be in the order of ±10%. Assuming a rate of 5% of non-responders, the target size has been set to 420 patients.",,Karolinska University Hospital,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,420.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,TREATMENT,,,QUADRUPLE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Symptoms of MDD include feelings of anxiety, guilt, or hopelessness; irregular sleep and appetite patterns; lethargy; excessive irritability and restlessness; inability to concentrate; and lack of enjoyment in previously enjoyed activities. Fortunately, MDD is treatable with forms of psychotherapy and/or antidepressant medications. Several studies have found that when given a choice, about two-thirds of depressed patients prefer psychotherapy treatment over antidepressant medication. Although psychotherapy treatments are both effective and desirable, a variety of barriers exist to initiating and sustaining psychotherapy. Only about 20% of all patients referred for psychotherapy treatments ever follow up. Of those who do initiate psychotherapy, nearly half drop out before completing treatment.

Delivering an intervention through telecommunication technologies, such as the telephone and Internet, has the potential to overcome many of the barriers to existing treatments for depression. For example, telephone- and Web-based interventions can reduce cost, extend specialized treatment over broad geographic areas, and permit considerable flexibility in scheduling of treatment components. Technology-assisted Behavioral Intervention(TABI) is a specific form of a telecommunication behavioral intervention that incorporates Web-based Internet, e-mail, and telephone intervention. Further study is needed to determine the effectiveness of TABI in reducing depressive symptoms and attrition rates in people with MDD. This pilot study will first develop TABI, which will consist of Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (I-CBT) accompanied by telephone and e-mail support. The study will then compare the effectiveness of TABI with the effectiveness of I-CBT alone and treatment as usual (TAU) in reducing depressive symptoms and improving treatment adherence in primary care patients with MDD.

Participation in the treatment phase of this study will last 12 weeks. All participants will first undergo initial assessments that will include a telephone interview and a series of questionnaires about mood. Eligible participants will then be assigned randomly to receive TABI, I-CBT alone, or TAU. Participants assigned to TABI and I-CBT will both undergo 12 weeks of a Web-based Internet intervention consisting of modules to help them learn skills to manage their moods.

4e5cae2c035258d1,NCT05263596,SARCOPEDIA - Sarcopenia Diagnostics in Aging Medicine,SARCOPEDIA - Sarcopenia Diagnostics in Aging Medicine,SARCOPEDIA,2021-01907,"Musculoskeletal aging is one of the major responsibilities and challenges for public health. In particular, sarcopenia correlates with an increased risk of falls and increased morbidity and mortality. With regard to screening for sarcopenia, the guidelines of the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP2) refer to algorithmic case finding, diagnosis, and quantification of the severity of sarcopenia in clinical. While functional measurements are more difficult to standardize and associated with higher variability, Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is considered a highly accurate method, even referred to as the ""gold standard"" to determine muscle mass in the scientific literature. Nevertheless, DXA, which is routinely used, shows inconsistent correlation with functional decline in muscle strength. Another method of muscle quantification is bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), a simple, portable instrument that is more readily available and applicable due to its lower cost. However, it tends to overestimate muscle mass and is also more susceptible to a person's hydration status. Because of these difficulties, recent research has focused on the potential of using shear wave elastography. This method indirectly serves to quantify the rapid type II muscle fibers in order to make statements about the muscle quality because an age-related decrease in type II muscle fibers is associated with a more frequent fall frequency.

First, the investigators will define three different categories according to the EWGSOP 2 guidelines based on the muscle strength (grip strength, assessed by pneumatic hand dynamometer) and muscle mass (Appendicular skeletal muscle mass, assessed by BIA): ""No Sarcopenia"", ""Probable Sarcopenia"" and ""Confirmed Sarcopenia"". Within these categories, the Investigators would like to establish a multivariate data analysis of different functional measurements with quantitative imaging results. This exploratory trial design is intended to improve understanding within the three categories and to test proxy measurements of different patients who are ruled out for common routine measurements due to, for example, cognitive impairment or pre-existing rheumatic disease. This is essential to consider the heterogeneity of the aging society proportionally.","Once written informed consent is available, the following data are extracted from the patient's medical records: age and gender, number of medications and number of pre-existing chronic conditions, statin therapy (binary evaluation yes/ no), the laboratory values for CRP, prealbumin, cholinesterase, GFR and CK, and results from geriatric assessment routinely performed by a physiotherapist at admission or a resident physician: Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), Clock-drawing test (CDT), Geriatric depression scale (GDS), Functional independence measure at admission (FIM) assessed by nurses or physiotherapist. Hand grip strength (HGS), Timed up and go Test (TUG) and Gait speed at admission assessed by physiotherapists; Nutritional risk screening (NRS) assessed by a nutritionist.

To complete baseline data, calf and mid-arm circumference will be measured. Meanwhile, the frailty of the participant is estimated by using the CFS.

For evaluation of muscle mass, body impedance analysis (BIA) is performed in all included patients using a BIVA 101® (Akern, SMT medical GmbH, Würzburg, Germany) within the first 6 days of hospitalization. To conduct this measurement, the patients lie in supine position with extremities stretched, not touching their core and not moving during the measurement. The measurement itself takes only a few seconds. Altogether, the measurements including the preparation phase will be performed within 10 to 15 minutes. As a potential bias, the hydration status of a patient can impair reliability of BIA results. Therefore, all measurements will take part at least 2 hours after the last meal in order to minimize possible fluctuations. If a patient suffers from an altered hydration status at admission (either clinically dehydrated or volume overloaded), the patient will be re-evaluated three days later and BIA measurement will be done if the patient is euvolemic at that time. Concerning those patients receiving continuous enteral feeding, BIA measurement will be performed only if \<150 ml/h were delivered in the preceding 2 hours.

For further assessment of muscle mass, non-invasive DXA provides the total body Skeletal Muscle Mass (SMM) and the Appendicular Skeletal Muscle Mass (ASM). For these examinations, the patient cannot stay at her/ his room and will be transferred to an examination room. There an experienced physician will be present if needed for medical assistance before, during or after measurements. The device used for this study is the iDXA densitometer (GE Healthcare, Madison, WI, USA). Here, the study participant moves to an examination couch. The instrument, which is located opposite the examination couch, has an open design and can be viewed from all sides. A narrow scanner runs over the body at a distance of about 20 cm. The examination itself takes about 5 minutes while the patient remains relaxed and calm, breathing normally. In principle, muscle mass is correlated with body size, i.e. persons with a larger body size usually have a larger muscle mass. Therefore, when quantifying muscle mass, the absolute level of SMM or ASM can be adjusted for body size in several ways, namely by using height squared (ASM/height2), weight (ASM/weight), or body mass index (ASM/BMI), all of which are included in the assessment. As a definition of sarcopenia, cut-off points from EWGSOP2 will be used. All precision scans are performed by the same radiologic technologist under the supervision of the project manager.

A subsequent ultrasound examination (Philips PureWave EPIQ 5G, Amsterdam, Netherlands) will be used to detect the elasticity via elastography of two muscles in defined positions. The measurements positions are the Musculus (M.) quadriceps femoris in a supine position on an examination couch and the M. biceps brachii in an elbow flexed position at 90° with the forearm rested on the body. The probe will be placed on top of the skin with a minimal load ensuring no external pressure could affect the measurements. The elastography will be recorded in kilopascals (kPa). The examination, which takes about 5 minutes is also completely painless, and will be performed by the project leader.

The CST is then performed under the supervision and guidance of the examining physician. This clinical test is also used to assess mobility and is estimated to take approximately 3 minutes.",University Department of Geriatric Medicine FELIX PLATTER,OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,120.0,NON_RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,,PREVENTION,,,SINGLE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

In this study, researchers will examine how the immune system responds to the vaccine when the four components are administered in three different ways:

1. The vaccine dose containing all four components is given as a single injection in one arm, and placebo injections are given in the other arm and both legs.
2. The vaccine dose containing all four components is divided into fourths, and one-fourth of the full dose is given in each arm and leg.
3. The four vaccine components are separated, and a different component is given in each arm and leg.

This study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected adults. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups. Group 1 will receive the entire dose of vaccine in their right arm and placebo vaccine in the other arm and both legs. Group 2 will receive all four different components of the vaccine, given separately as a different component per each arm and leg. Group 3 will receive the entire vaccine dose divided into fourths, with one fourth of the full dose given in each arm and leg.

At a baseline study visit, participants will undergo a physical examination and a medical and medication history review. Female participants will also take a pregnancy test. Participants will complete questionnaires and receive counseling on HIV risk reduction and pregnancy prevention. All participants will then receive vaccine given as four injections-one each in their right arm, left arm, right thigh, and left thigh (except for Group 1, placebo injections are given in left arm and both legs). After receiving the vaccine, participants will remain in the clinic for at least 30 minutes for observation and monitoring of side effects.

The current approach to the perioperative management of anticoagulation (i.e. ""bridging therapy"") with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is not standardized and has not been assessed by adequate randomized studies. Most clinicians, however, recommend bridging therapy.

We have recently completed a multicentre single arm pilot study of LMWH bridging therapy. This study in 10 centres accrued 224 patients in 10 months. In the pilot study the postoperative thromboembolic event rate was 3.1% and 75% of these occurred in patients who had anticoagulation held due to bleeding.

Design:A prospective multicentre randomized double-blind controlled trial. Patients: Consecutive eligible and consenting patients from 11 teaching hospitals in Canada. A total of 1773 patients with prosthetic heart valves receiving long-term oral anticoagulation with warfarin or patients with atrial fibrillation/flutter and a major risk factor who require elective non-cardiac surgery or invasive procedure necessitating reversal of their oral anticoagulant therapy.

Treatment Schedule: Consent will be obtained preoperatively but randomization will be performed postoperatively after confirming eligibility.

Preoperative period: In all participants, warfarin therapy will be discontinued five days prior to the procedure. Dalteparin, a LMWH, will be administered at 200 IU/kg sc early in the morning for the three days prior to, but not including the day of, the procedure except on the day prior to surgery the dose will be 100 I.U./kg given 24 hours preoperatively. Warfarin will be resumed the evening of the procedure.

Postoperative period: Dalteparin or placebo will be administered daily (starting the morning after the procedure), provided surgical hemostasis is achieved, and will be continued for at least four days and until the INR is\>2.0. Patients considered at high risk for a postoperative major bleed will be given dalteparin or placebo at a dose of 5,000 IU sc daily. Patients who undergo procedures that are considered low risk for bleeding complications will resume dalteparin or placebo at 200 IU/Kg s.c. daily.

Outcomes:The primary outcome will be the frequency of episodes of major thromboembolism over a 90-day follow-up period following the time of randomization. Secondary outcomes will include major bleeding and overall survival.

Relevance: To bridge or not to bridge, is a common clinical question, without randomized trial evidence to guide clinicians. This RCT will answer whether post-operative bridging reduces risk of thromboembolism or causes harm.",London Health Sciences Centre Research Institute OR Lawson Research Institute of St. Joseph's,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,1473.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,PREVENTION,,,QUADRUPLE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

40bb9f14631e9ab1,NCT02189096,Validation of Early Warning Score & Lactate in Prehospital Screening,Validation of Early Warning Score & Lactate in Prehospital Screening,VELPS,VELPS,"Sepsis claims over 37,000 lives in the United Kingdom each year- more than lung cancer, and more than breast cancer, bowel cancer and HIV/AIDS combined. Less than two-thirds of patients who develop sepsis will survive. Sepsis can affect a person of any age, social background, and can strike irrespective of underlying medical conditions.

An important element in improving the care of patient with sepsis is early identification and early intervention, both of which have been shown to improve outcomes. Physiological deterioration often precedes clinical deterioration as patients develop critical illness. Recognition of this has led to the development of Early Warning Score (EWS) systems which allow earlier identification of physiological deterioration. By assigning numerical values to various physiological parameters, a composite score can be assigned to a patient, allowing early identification of patients who are at risk of critical illness.

EWS were initially developed to assist in the management of patients in the general ward setting. A recent study has shown that an increased EWS on arrival at the Emergency Department (ED) is associated with higher odds of adverse outcome amongst patients with sepsis. Consequently, the use of EWS could facilitate patient pathways to ensure triage to a high acuity area of the ED and senior clinician involvement at an early stage. The use of a standard single National EWS (NEWS) across the National Health Service in the United Kingdom has been recommended to improve patient care.

NEWS also lends itself to extension to pre-hospital care and ambulance services. Most ambulance services routinely collect the physiological data required to calculate a NEWS score and indeed some ambulance services have incorporated this into electronic patient record forms (ePRF). An agreed NEWS score of greater than a specific level could be used as a trigger for ambulance service pre-alert of a receiving ED.

Point of care measurement of lactate has also been shown to be feasible in the ED. Serum lactate is recognised as an independent predictor of mortality in sepsis and there may be potential for combining NEWS systems and point of care to further improve diagnostic accuracy for patients at risk of adverse outcomes.

In this study, we aim to apply the use of early warning scores and point of care testing to a cohort of all ambulance patients to assess the feasibility and utility of this approach.","Study Question or Objective:

Are NEWS score, Sepsis Screening and Lactate measurement predictors of outcome in unselected out of hospital patients?

Specific Aims:

To determine whether the following, alone or in combination, are predictors of outcome, namely in-hospital mortality within 24 hours or 30 days or ICU admission within two days:

* a single prehospital NEWS performed on arrival of the Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS)
* Prehospital Sepsis screening (SIRS criteria and evidence of infection) on arrival of the SAS
* Prehospital Point of Care Lactate performed when NEWS is greater than or equal to 4 or when Sepsis is present

Background Information:

NHS Scotland is committed to improving the outcome of patients with Sepsis and the Deteriorating Patient as evidenced by their inclusion in the Scottish Patient Safety Programme. An important element in improving the care of Sepsis and the deteriorating patient is early identification and early intervention, both of which have been shown to improve outcomes.

Physiological deterioration often precedes clinical deterioration as patients develop critical illness. Recognition of this has led to the development of Early Warning Scoring (EWS) systems, which allow earlier identification of physiological deterioration. By assigning numerical values to various physiological parameters, a composite score can be assigned to a patient, allowing early identification of patients who are at risk of critical illness.

EWS were initially established to assist in the management of patients in the general ward setting. A recent study has shown that an increased EWS on arrival at the Emergency Department (ED) is associated with higher odds of adverse outcome amongst patients with sepsis. Consequently, the use of EWS could facilitate patient pathways to ensure triage to a high acuity area of the ED and senior clinician involvement at an early stage. The use of a standard single National EWS (NEWS) across the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom has been recommended to improve patient care.

NEWS also lends itself to extension to prehospital care and ambulance services. Most ambulance services routinely collect the physiological data required to calculate a NEWS score and indeed some ambulance services have incorporated this into electronic patient report forms (ePRF). The Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS) has this in place. An agreed NEWS score of greater than a specific level could be used as a trigger for ambulance service pre-alert of a receiving ED. However controversy exists as to whether NEWS is valid in the prehospital environment.

Point of care lactate testing has also been shown to be feasible in the ED. Measurement of in hospital serum lactate is recognised as an independent predictor of mortality in sepsis and trauma and there may be potential for combining NEWS systems and point of care to further improve diagnostic accuracy for patients at risk of adverse outcomes. Prehospital Point of care lactate testing has also shown some promise as a predictor of outcome in trauma patients.

Previous studies have focused on using early warning scores and point of care lactate on specific patient groups. Identification of conditions such as sepsis can be challenging, particularly in the prehospital environment.

In this study, we aim to apply the use of early warning scores and point of care testing to a cohort of all ambulance patients to assess the feasibility and utility of this approach.

Study Design:

Setting Five areas within NHS Scotland have been identified and each area will have two paramedic crews taking part in the study. The five areas include NHS Greater Glasgow \& Clyde (Royal Alexandra Hospital), NHS Dumfries \& Galloway (Dumfries \& Galloway Royal Infirmary), NHS Fife (Victoria Hospital), NHS Lothian (Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh) and NHS Western Isles (Western Isles Hospital). These areas have been chosen to represent the spectrum of clinical settings in NHS Scotland from dense urban areas to remote and rural area.

Posters will be placed in all ambulances in the five clinical areas informing patients that anonymised data is being collected for this study.

Methods The study will run for a 12-month period. The design is a prospective, non-randomised, 3 staged interventional study.

Phase 1 (4 months)

No change from current practice. Each Paramedic crew routinely documents patient observations in an electronic Patient Report Form (ePRF) on every patient encounter. These physiological parameters will be electronically captured. The data will be used to calculate NEWS and screen for Sepsis (2 or more modified SIRS criteria \[signs of systemic inflammation\] and suspicion of infection) by the study investigators. An estimate will be made of the time of completion of the ePRF in relation to patient transport.

The National Early Warning Score (NEWS) contains seven physiological parameters, each of which is assigned a value of between 0 and 3 (0 and 2 for supplemental oxygen). The score for each parameter is summed to calculate the NEWS which may range between 0 and 20; the higher the score the greater the deviation from normality. The NEWS is based on previous similar scoring systems.

Sepsis is defined as the presence of SIRS criteria with the suspicion of infection.

Phase 2 (4 months)

The ten crews will undertake implementation of NEWS and Sepsis Screening. Prior to this stage of the study, each crew will attend a half day educational session covering the rationale for the use of NEWS.

Each Paramedic crew will continue to routinely document patient observations in an electronic Patient Report Form (ePRF) on every patient encounter. These physiological parameters will be used to calculate NEWS and screen for Sepsis (2 or more modified SIRS criteria and suspicion of infection). The NEWS will be available to the paramedic crew.

If NEWS is greater than or equal to 4 or the patient screens positive for Sepsis, the patients transfer will be as per normal protocol but receiving ED staff will receive the information about NEWS score and Sepsis screening as part of a structured handover.

Phase 3 ( 4 months)

The ten crews will undertake Point of Care Lactate measurement when NEWS ≥ 4 or when the patient screens positive for Sepsis. Each Paramedic crew will continue to routinely document patient observations in an electronic Patient Report Form (ePRF) on every patient encounter. These physiological parameters will be used to calculate NEWS and screen for Sepsis (2 or more modified SIRS criteria and suspicion of infection). If NEWS is greater than or equal to 4 or the patient screens positive for Sepsis, then a Lactate will be measured on the CG4+ i-STAT cartridge. The lactate level, along with the NEWS score and sepsis screening, will be given to the receiving ED staff as part of a structured handover.

Each crew will undergo a further half day educational session covering the use of the point of care lactate meter.

Within all NHS Scotland hospitals, health care practitioners currently screen for sepsis when NEWS is ≥ 4, and are measuring lactate if there is a positive screen for sepsis. Lactate point of care measurement is currently being piloted in the prehospital setting in Forth Valley Health Board

The i-STAT handheld analyser that will be used in this study is CE marked, and has undergone performance verification against GEM Premier 400 and ROCHE OMNI S blood gas analysers. It is currently used clinically within NHSGG\&C health board, several other Scottish health boards and the Emergency Medical Retrieval Service (EMRS).

For the 12-month duration of the study paramedic crews will continue to work within Scottish Ambulance Service protocols and under the principles of UK Ambulance Clinical Practice Guidelines, including any changes made to SAS protocols during this time. Any changes will be noted by the study investigators.

Data Collection A researcher will obtain data for all patients in the study from the ePRF records via the SAS Data Warehouse. This data will be stored as a spreadsheet file in accordance with NHS data protection guidance. The researcher will then match this data with the Wardwatcher system at the receiving Intensive Care Units regarding ICU admission and ICU mortality. Data will be sought from \<hospital information systems\> at each receiving site regarding 30 day mortality.

Linked data will be anonymised and given a unique identifier. The anonymised data will then be analysed by an independent statistician, as described in the analysis plan.

Exposure to nickel is responsible for two different types of adverse reactions: Allergic Contact Dermatitis (DAC) and Systemic Nickel Allergy Syndrome (SNAS). The latter is characterized by the presence of extra-cutaneous manifestations, in addition to the skin lesions of the DAC, related to the introduction of nickel-containing foods. Therefore, a nutritional intervention is essential to reduce the symptoms of SNAS. Currently in the literature there are no nutritional guidelines on the treatment and management of patients suffering from SNAS and often the indications provided to patients involve the exclusion of groups of foods for prolonged periods, with the consequent risk of developing nutritional deficiencies and malnutrition.

Objectives: to evaluate the efficacy of dietary indications, developed on the most recent scientific evidence, useful for the management of the symptoms associated with adverse reactions to Nickel. Provide practical indications to specialist staff in multidisciplinary patient management and make the patient aware of his problem and help him understand how to manage it independently.

Target population: subjects over the age of 18, female, belonging to the U.O. Occupational Medicine Allergology Section at ICS Maugeri of Pavia, with previous diagnosis of Nickel allergy (patch test) and with the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms related to allergy.","The primary objective of this intervention study is the evaluation of the efficacy of dietary indications, developed on the most recent scientific evidence, useful for the management of the symptoms associated with adverse reactions to nickel.

The secondary objective is to:

* verify the correlation between the consumption of a specific food and the onset of gastroenteric symptoms;
* provide a practical indication to the dietician who acts in concert with the figure of the dietician and allergist in the multidisciplinary management of the patient in order to manage and contain the symptoms;
* make the patient aware of his problem and help him understand how to manage it autonomously, from a food point of view, thus promoting a diet as complete and balanced as possible and at the same time reduce the risk of nutritional deficiencies, such as deficits of minerals and vitamins, and the consequent impact on the state of health.

In this experimental study, each patient will be assessed at the baseline time (T0) in which the pathological and physiological history and anthropometric data (weight, height, waist circumference, BMI) will be collected.The patients of the intervention group will be given dietetic indications by the reference dietitian, which must be followed for 8 weeks. In short, the indications provide for an exclusion period (4 weeks). At the end of this phase (T1) one group of foods per week will be reintroduced on the basis of their nickel content.The reintroduction will begin with the group of foods with a lower nickel content and will proceed gradually for a period of 4 weeks (T1a, T1b, T1c, T2). In order to monitor the trend of gastroenteric symptoms, a diary of symptoms will be administered at baseline time (T0) which must be completed for the duration of the study (T1a, T1b, T1c, T2) and which will be delivered and evaluated by the dietician and the reference clinician.

This technique is referred to as intraoperative electrocorticography (IOECOG).

IOECOG has been used to localize the site of epileptogenicity through the demonstration of Interictal Epileptiform Discharges (IED) persistence, frequency, and distribution.

The investigators will measure the independent contribution of risk factors such as delirium and exposure to sedative and analgesic medications to the incidence of long-term CI, controlling for established risk factors (e.g., age, pre-existing CI, and apoE genotype). Defining the contributions of these risk factors will make it possible to develop preventive and/or treatment strategies to reduce the incidence, severity and/or duration of long-term CI and improve functional recovery of patients with acute critical illness.","Advances in critical care have led to improved survival among those admitted to intensive care units (ICUs). However, survival is lower among those who develop ICU delirium, and the quality of life among survivors may be affected by post-ICU long-term cognitive impairment (CI) that lasts months to years. Long-term CI has been studied predominantly following cardiopulmonary bypass. In the much larger group of medical and general surgical ICU patients, the extent of this problem and its relationship to health-related quality of life is poorly characterized. Evidence from 6 pilot cohorts (including the investigators') totaling \~300 patients suggests that an astonishing 30% to 80% of ICU survivors experience long-term CI functionally equivalent to mild/moderate dementia although it may not be progressive (and thus will be referred to as long-term CI). Interestingly, this cognitive impairment arises independent of severity of illness, and older patients appear particularly prone. The investigators' work and the work of others have shown that delirium is a major independent risk factor for impaired cognitive function at hospital discharge and increased mortality at 6 months. While it is not clear whether delirium itself is injurious to the brain or is simply a marker of brain injury, it is clear that the onset of delirium in the ICU should not be considered innocuous; rather, it may be a determinant of long-term CI and health-related quality of life. Having spent the last 8 years studying delirium and drug exposure during acute phases of critical illness and long-term CI after hospitalization, the investigators are thoroughly prepared to continue the next phases of investigation in VA (Department of Veterans Affairs) patients, many of whom are older and disproportionately at risk for adverse outcomes following ICU care.",VA Office of Research and Development,FED,SPONSOR,OBSERVATIONAL,,ACTUAL,800.0,,,,,COHORT,PROSPECTIVE,,SAMPLES_WITH_DNA,Blood,"Inclusion Criteria:

   Total knee replacement (TKR) is a common procedure, with more than 100,000 per year undertaken in England and Wales. Although most patients have a successful outcome following their TKR, approximately 10-20% of patients are dissatisfied, chiefly because of pain and knee stiffness. A method to detect early problems with pain and stiffness could facilitate earlier referral to non-surgical treatments, which are effective in preventing the need for manipulation under anaesthetic \[MUA\]. Currently, rates of MUA are 2.5% (\~2,500 patients per year in England and Wales), costing \~£14k per procedure. Our current understanding of when stiffness develops and the timing and best treatment(s) for stiffness are limited. A recent James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership identified stiffness after TKR as a top-10 research priority to better understand and test interventions. Current measures are not accurate or suitable for use in the home. The investigators need tools to accurately measure early indicators for stiffness.
2. Rationale

The investigators currently have no tool to remotely and accurately detect development of early post-surgical knee stiffness. This study aims to develop a cost-effective tool to measure and quantify knee stiffness before and after total knee replacement (TKR) surgery for use across the NHS. The research seeks to understand how knee range of motion (ROM) recovers after TKR and detect early signs of stiffness. It also aims to predict who might develop stiffness after TKR and explore the relationship between pain and stiffness.

Current methods for measuring knee range of motion (ROM), such as hand-held tools for measuring angles, have limitations in terms of accuracy and need trained healthcare staff to use them. The ideal tool would be low-cost, easy to use, and provide rapid feedback to patients and clinical teams. The study will involve the development and validation of a computer vision-based approach (using cameras to assess movements) to monitor knee flexion and extension, and a walking pattern assessment. Video-based technology or computer vision (CV) has recently been pioneered in Exeter to measure spine movement in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Computer vision is an emerging technology that has great potential for monitoring knee flexion in people with knee stiffness. This approach involves the use of cameras and machine learning algorithms to detect and analyse knee joint angles during movement automatically. By providing objective and accurate measurements of knee flexion, computer vision has the potential to improve the assessment of knee stiffness and facilitate targeted treatment interventions. However, as with any new technology, there is a need to validate the method in the context of patients with knee stiffness to ensure its accuracy and reliability. Studies have highlighted the importance of developing machine learning algorithms specifically for this patient population to account for individual differences in movement patterns and limitations due to stiffness. Further research is needed to assess the validity and feasibility of computer vision-based approaches for monitoring knee flexion in people with knee stiffness, which could ultimately improve the diagnosis, monitoring, and management of this condition.

Validation of the computer vision-based approach for monitoring knee flexion in people with knee stiffness is essential to ensure its reliability and accuracy. This requires developing and refining machine learning algorithms that can accurately detect and measure knee joint angles in this patient population. This study will evaluate the accuracy and precision of the algorithm against gold-standard measurement methods, such as motion capture or goniometry. Furthermore, this study will examine the sensitivity of the approach to changes in knee flexion due to stiffness and pain and assess its feasibility in a clinical setting. Once validated, the computer vision-based approach has the potential to provide a non-invasive and objective means of monitoring knee flexion in people with knee stiffness, which could inform treatment decisions and improve patient outcomes.

Another tool which the investigators will use is the Gaitcapture app which takes advantage of the accelerometer and gyroscope sensor in a mobile phone and acts similarly to an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to provide us with acceleration and rotation data.

The validation of the computer vision-based approach will involve comparing it against gold-standard measurement methods (specialist physiotherapy assessment).

In addition to the computer vision-based approach, the study will utilise body-worn sensors and mobile apps to monitor the physical activity levels, walking patterns and step counts of participants. This data will provide insights into people with TKR's overall physical activity patterns and help evaluate the usability, acceptability, feasibility, and accuracy of the tools for diagnostics and monitoring.

The findings of this research project have the potential to improve the diagnosis, monitoring, and management of knee stiffness after total knee replacement (TKR), with the potential to reducing the need for MUA surgery. By providing accurate measurements and early detection, the tools developed in this study could enable earlier referral to non-surgical treatments and reduce the need for costly and risky procedures to improve knee range of motion (ROM) after total knee replacement (TKR) surgery, like a manipulation of the knee under anaesthesia.

Here, the investigators will conduct a validation study of a marker-less motion capture algorithm to determine its accuracy and assess its feasibility and usability for implementation on a large scale in the home. the investigators will also ascertain the test-retest reliability of algorithm outputs such as knee flexion/extension angles.",University of Exeter,OTHER,SPONSOR,OBSERVATIONAL,False,ESTIMATED,75.0,,,,,CASE_CONTROL,PROSPECTIVE,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Although it improves the clinical picture of most SMA patients, not all exhibit the same response to treatment. In this project the aim will be: i. identifying cell-free SMN circular RNAs (circRNAs) in body fluids of SMA patients as potential biomarkers before and after Nusinersen; ii. evaluating their prognostic power as predictors of the clinical response of SMA patients to Nusinersen; iii. identifying human intronic polymorphisms that affect SMN circRNAs biogenesis and impact on the efficacy of Nusinersen. The results obtainable with this project will evaluate if different concentration of cell free SMN circRNAs in SMA patients could underlie the genotype-phenotype mismatch, usually observed, and the reduced response of a subset of SMA patients to therapy. Our research could highlight the need for these of combinatorial 'SMN-plus' and ""personalized"" therapies that account for individual differences.","Background/State of the art SMA represents the most frequent genetic cause of death in infancy with an incidence of \~1 in 10,000 live births . It is an autosomal recessive, neurodegenerative disorder caused by homozygous deletion or point mutation in the SMN1 gene, which encodes for SMN protein. Reduced SMN levels cause loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and lead to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy in SMA patients. Notably, humans retain the almost identical SMN2 gene, as the complete absence of any form of SMN is embryonically lethal. Nevertheless, although SMN2 encodes a virtually identical protein, its expression levels are not sufficient to fully restore SMN activity because a translationally silent C-to-T transition at position +6 in exon 7 determines skipping of this exon from the mature mRNA. The resulting SMN7 protein displays a shorter C-terminal region and is highly unstable. At the moment Nusinersen is the only FDA-approved drug for treatment of SMA. It is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that corrects SMN2 exon 7 splicing by masking a splicing silencer (ISS-N1) in intron 7 . Although intrathecal administration of Nusinersen ameliorates SMA phenotypes in patients, leading to substantial improvements in motor function, not all SMA patients respond equally well to this therapy. Thus, identification and development of combined and personalized therapies that take into account clinical variability observed between patients of the same genotype is necessary to improve clinical management of SMA. Due to their biochemical properties (stability, accumulation during aging, abundant secretion in body fluids) circular RNAs are now emerging as excellent and promising biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of numerous pathologies, such as cancer. Thousands of circRNAs have been discovered in eukaryotic cells and their expression is often regulated in a cell-type and stage-specific manner. Although the majority of circRNAs still lack functional annotations, recent observations revealed that they play some potentially important roles in gene regulation. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) originate from a back-splicing process of the pre-mRNA (i.e., the covalent joining of a downstream splice donor site with an upstream splice acceptor site from the same gene). Since canonical splicing and back-splicing utilize the same pre-mRNA and are both operated by the spliceosome, they likely compete with each other. The main mechanism favoring pre-mRNA circularization is the presence of repetitive sequences in inverted orientation, and in particular inverted Alu repeats.

Alu repeats belong to the primate-specific Short Interspersed Elements (SINE) family of retrotransposons. They are \~300 nucleotides long and account for up to 11% of the annotated human genome. Their presence in coding genes can modulate gene expression at multiple layers, including transcription, splicing, export and translation, thus profoundly impacting on their ""host"" gene regulation. SMN rank among the top human genes for Alu density, many of which are present in inverted orientation. Strikingly, Alus drive extensive and alternative circularization of the SMN pre-mRNA, thus negatively impacting on the protein-coding potential of the locus. Thus, based on the preliminary results, the propose will be to investigate whether cell-free SMN circRNAs circulating in body fluids of SMA patients represent biomarkers exhibiting diagnostic and prognostic power to predict the clinical response to Nusinersen therapy.

Hypothesis and significance:

The studies proposed in this project aim at investigating whether SMN circRNAs represent valuable biomarkers to predict the efficacy of Nusinersen in SMA patients that exhibit different degrees of disease severity. In particular, our work may help to better stratify the numerous SMA patients which do not respond as expected to treatment and/or for whom the SMN2 gene copy number does not correlate with phenotypic severity. Since extensive production of SMN circular transcripts, instead of the linear transcripts, in some patients could reduce the efficacy of Nusinersen, which selectively acts on the linear transcript, our study may also highlight the need for combined therapy to also limit pre- mRNA circularization in such patients. In the near future, the development of ""personalized"" therapies could circumvent such ""individual"" differences in the regulation of SMN expression, thus improving the clinical response of SMA patients to Nusinersen.

Preliminary data:

Whole genome comparison of Alu density highlighted SMN among the top-ranking human genes. Inspection of Alu position and orientation in SMN revealed the presence of several inter-intronic inverted repeat Alu elements (IRAlus) that could mediate circRNA biogenesis. Our bioinformatics analysis (data not shown) highlighted numerous IRAlus in intron 1 and 6, the longest introns in SMN, thus potentially favoring back-splicing of exon 6 with exon 2a. Indeed, RT-PCR using divergent primers in exon 2b and exon 6 followed by sequencing identified a circRNA in both human SMA fibroblasts (GM03813) and HEK293T cells. Since back-splicing events occur at the expense of canonical splicing, was hypothesized a competition between the biogenesis of circular and linear transcripts that could impact on SMN protein expression. In line with the hypothesis, loss of DHX9, a helicase that represses circRNA biogenesis, significantly increased the expression of SMN circRNAs and reduced the expression of the SMN protein. Furthermore, the administration of ASO E8, that masks a cryptic 5\&39; SS in exon 8 that is used for biogenesis of two circRNAs, but not for linear SMN splicing, selectively reduced the target SMN circRNAs and rescued SMN protein expression to \~30% of the efficacy of the ISSN1 ASO. These results indicate that SMN circRNAs competes with the protein-coding potential of the locus.

Specific Aims 1:

Identification of cell-free SMN circRNAs in body fluids of SMA patients as potential biomarkers before and after Nusinersen treatment

Specific Aims 2:

Evaluation of prognostic power of circulating SMN circRNAs as predictors of the clinical response of SMA patients to Nusinersen

Specific Aims 3:

Identification of human intronic polymorphisms present within inverted Alu elements and their impact on the efficacy of Nusinersen treatment

Experimental Design Aim 1:

SMA patients will be enrolled based on genetic documentation of a homozygous deletion or mutation in the SMN1 gene and they will be grouped in SMA type-I (1.1, 1.5 and 1.9), SMA type-II (from 2.3 to 2.9) and SMA type-III (3A and 3B) based on SMN2 gene copy number and onset of clinical symptoms. The plan will be to enroll ten patients/group, however, the exact number of patients for each group will be based on the level of heterogeneity detected.

Testing the expression of cell-free SMN circRNAs isolated from plasma, urine and cerebrospinal fluid of SMA patients and evaluating the correlation between SMN circRNA concentration and disease severity. In parallel, evaluating the expression level of SMN2 linear transcripts in peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs) for each patient to assess whether linear SMN2 mRNA expression is inversely related to SMN circRNA biogenesis and whether this parameter accounts for SMN expression and disease severity independently of SMN2 copy number.

The evaluation of the concentration of SMN circRNAs varies over time in Nusinersen-treated SMA patients by measuring their concentration in body fluids before and after 6 months of drug administration, according to standard therapeutic regimen in use in our Unit. Briefly, Nusinersen will be administered with intrathecal injection of initial loading doses (12mg/5ml) at days 1, 15, 30, 60, followed by less frequent maintenance doses (every 4 months). This dosing regimen is designed to provide an appropriate level of medication that is maintained between each dose.

In parallel to the in vivo study, testing the effects of Nusinersen on SMN circRNAs biogenesis in pre-clinical models of SMA. Human type-I SMA fibroblasts (GM03813, GM09766 and GM00232; Corriell Institute), which are already available in our laboratory, will be transfected with ISSN1 ASO, that mimics the effect of Nusinersen treatment, and SMN circRNAs expression will be analyzed by qPCR.

Experimental Design Aim 2:

Although approximately half of SMA patients show substantial improvements in motor function following treatment, Nusinersen seems to exert more modest effects in others. In light of this, SMA patients with same eligibility criteria (SMN2 copy number, onset and clinical symptoms) will be stratified into three subgroups based on the concentration of circulating cell-free SMN circRNAs (high, intermediate and low) and their responsiveness to the Nusinersen will be evaluated after the 5th injection of the drug (6 months after the first administration). Evaluation criteria of treatment efficacy consist in HINE (Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination) and CHOP INTEND (Children Hospital Of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorder) for SMA type-I, in neurological examination and HFMSE (Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale-Expandend) for type-II and in neurological examination, HFMSE and 6MWT (6 Minute Walk Test) for type-III patients. This study could also benefit of retrospective analyses already performed by our Unit.

Experimental Design Aim 3:

The inverse correlation between the number of SMN2 copy and disease severity is not observed in all SMA patients (i.e. type-III cases having 2 copies of SMN2 or type-I cases with 3). Moreover, not all SMA patients respond similarly to Nusinersen therapy (i.e. discordant siblings with the same copy number). On the basis of the competition between linear and circular processing of SMN pre-mRNA, evaluating whether a differential SMN circularization index (understood as propensity of SMN pre-mRNA to circulate) could underlie these observed discrepancies. To this aim, it will perform Next Generation Sequencing analysis (Genosplice, Paris, France) of the entire SMN2 gene from genomic DNA of \~100 patients in which the SMN2 gene copy number does not correlate with phenotypic severity or whose response to Nusinersen treatment is below expectation. In particular, it will focus on intronic SMN2 polymorphisms harbored in inverted Alu elements, which could affect the circularization index of SMN2 pre-mRNA.

Furthermore, in order to determine whether the selected intronic polymorphisms impact on SMN circRNAs biogenesis it will perform in vitro mutagenesis experiments. The mutants will be transfected in human SMA fibroblasts or HEK293T and their circularization efficiency will be tested by qPCR for specific back-splice junctions.

Methodologies and statistical analyses:

The RNA from plasma of SMA patients will be extracted by using miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Kit by Qiagen (cat. no. 217184) and after treated with RNase R to degrade linear RNAs while preserving circRNAs. Kit by Qiagen is also recommended for the extraction of RNA from other body fluids, such as urine. The expression of SMN circRNAs will be evaluated by qPCR analyses using primers specific for the SMN circular splice junctions, previously identified (see Preliminary Results). As an internal control, 100 ng total RNA of C. elegans will artificially add into each body fluid specimen before RNA extraction.

The quantitative data will be expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Two-tailed Student's t test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison post-test will be performed using Prism 6.0 software (GraphPad Software).

Expected outcomes:

Aim1: determine the expression and concentration of circulating cell-free SMN circRNAs in body fluids of SMA patients and identify the specific body fluid where they are more abundant and on which most of the following experiments will be performed.

Furthermore,evaluating whether there is a direct correlation between the degree of severity of SMA pathology and the concentration of SMN circRNAs.

This study will also shed light on the possible dual role of this molecule on linear and circular SMN2 transcript expression, an important issue to test now considering that the majority of patients are already receiving Nusinersen therapy and in the near future the recruitment of drug-naive patients might be nearly impossible.

Aim2: determine whether SMA patients with a high concentration of cell-free SMN circRNAs have a reduced responsiveness to Nusinersen treatment, as this molecule selectively acts on the SMN2 linear transcription.

Aim3: identify human intronic polymorphisms, within inverted Alu elements, which interfere with SMN circRNAs biogenesis and have an impact on SMA phenotype. Interestingly, part of the identified mutations could underlie the genotype-phenotype mismatch or the failure from some SMA patients to respond to Nusinersen treatment.

Risk analysis, possible problems and solutions:

A critical point of the project is represented by the possibility that SMN circRNAs are difficult to detect in the body fluids of SMA patients. Anyway, a large and growing body of studies show the presence of numerous and abundant circular RNAs in plasma of patients, indicating their role as excellent biomarkers for diagnosis (Li et al., Cell Research, 2015). Thus, it is likely that export of circRNAs is a common and widespread process which also involves SMN circRNAs. Moreover, techniques to detect RNA in liquid biopsies are continuously improving, making the possibility to be unable to detect SMN circRNAs less likely. The remaining part of the project does not present particular risks neither regarding the recruitment of SMA patients, which are already enrolled in the Pera Unit, nor regarding the molecular and cellular techniques that are routinely used by the Pagliarini Unit. Genomic sequencing (Aim 3) will be performed by GenoSplice, a leader in next generation sequencing analyses, which has already collaborated with us in bioinformatics analyses. Nevertheless, in the worst scenario, if our studies demonstrate that SMN circRNAs are not good biomarkers, our project will lead to the identification of SMN2 gene variants associated with the milder and more severe SMA phenotype, providing a useful tool to predict the efficacy of the Nusinersen treatment.

Significance and innovation Due to their biochemical properties, circulating SMN circRNAs could represent promising biomarkers to predict the onset and the progression of disease, as well as the clinical response to Nusinersen treatment. Their concentration within body fluids might represent a valid parameter to stratify SMA patients that exhibit different responses to Nusinersen in spite of similar or identical genetic diagnosis. Furthermore, our studies could highlight the need of robust combinatorial 'SMN-plus' therapies for subset of patients, which may be required to generate long-lasting responses in SMA patients.

Our project also aims at identifying hidden intronic variants of SMN2 which may affect the final amount of SMN2 transcripts produced and determine the degree of severity of the SMA phenotype. Such hidden mutations would allow to more accurately predict the SMA phenotype from genotype and, thus, paving the way for the development of ""personalized"" therapies that account for ""individual"" differences.",Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,OBSERVATIONAL,False,ESTIMATED,91.0,,,,,COHORT,PROSPECTIVE,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

The purpose of this study is to examine the role of host and viral factors in HIV disease progression in this unique HIV infected population.","The HIV epidemic in China has reached a phase of exponential growth. Among the infected are FBDs in rural communities, who became infected through contaminated blood collection equipment. In Fuyang, Anhui Province, China, unregulated commercial blood collection occurred from 1992 to 1995; during the last decade or so, some HIV infected FBDs have progressed to AIDS, while others are long-term nonprogressors, not requiring antiretroviral therapy (ART). Since the HIV infected participants in this study are predicted to have been infected by the same or related HIV strain because of their location and how they were infected, this is a unique population to study. It is hypothesized that host factors, such as host immunity and genetic background, are better predictors of disease progression than viral factors in this population. This study will enroll HIV-1 infected FBDs and age-matched HIV uninfected adults in Fuyang, Anhui Province, China.

There are two stages in this study. Stage I is a cross-sectional study and will last 3 months. Participants will be HIV-1 infected FBDs and age-matched HIV uninfected controls. There are two study visits in Stage I; there will be a 2-day screening/enrollment visit and a follow-up visit. On the first day of screening/enrollment, participants will be briefed about the study and will be asked to complete demographic and risk factor questionnaires; medical and medication history will be reviewed and a physical examination will also occur. All participants will receive HIV prevention education and risk reduction counseling; additionally, HIV uninfected participants will receive HIV pretest counseling. On the second day of screening, participants will return to the clinic for blood collection, and females will undergo a pregnancy test. All participants will return to the clinic to receive their laboratory results and post-test counseling at a follow-up visit occurring approximately 2 weeks after their screening/enrollment visit. Any participant with a CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3 or meeting other China Comprehensive AIDS Response (CARES) treatment criteria will be referred for further evaluation and care. HIV infected FBD participants with a CD4 count of 200 cells/mm3 or more will be invited to enroll in Stage II.

Stage II is a longitudinal, prospective study and will last 19.5 months. Stage II will enroll eligible HIV infected participants from Stage I and if necessary, other eligible patients referred from China CARES.

Forty four patients were included in this study. Inclusion criteria were posterior mandibular teeth having symptomatic irreversible pulpitis and symptomatic apical periodontitis. Patients were randomized into two equal groups. In the intervention group the functional and nonfunctional cusps were reduced until absence of contact was confirmed, while in the control group the occlusal surfaces were left intact. Standard endodontic treatment was performed in two visits using rotary nickel titanium files for shaping, 2.5% sodium hypochlorite for cleaning and lateral condensation technique with resin sealer for obturation. Pain was assessed preoperatively, then after 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours following instrumentation, then after 6 and 12 hours following obturation. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used as the primary outcome measure. Patients were given a placebo to be administrated in case of severe pain and ibuprofen 400mg was prescribed in case of persistent pain.","Recruitment of the study participants was done from the outpatient clinic of the Endodontic Department of the Faculty of Oral and Dental Medicine, Cairo University.

Randomization was done to assign participants to the study groups by chance and not choice. 44 numbers were generated and randomly allocated to either intervention or control group on a table using Microsoft Office Excel 2010. Each participant was given a number from 1 to 44 according to his turn in enrollment in the study.

Root canal treatment was completed in two visits. Before treatment, each patient was given pain scale chart and was asked to record their pain level. The tooth was anesthetized using inferior alveolar nerve block technique by local anesthesia of 1.8 - 3.6 ml of 2% Mepivacaine HCl. The access cavity preparation was performed using round carbide bur and Endo-z bur. After access cavity in the intervention group, all occlusal contacts on the functional and non-functional cusps as well as on the marginal ridges were reduced using a wheel diamond bur. Absence of contact was confirmed using an articulating paper. In the control group, all occlusal contacts were left intact. The tooth was then properly isolated with rubber dam. The patency of the root canals was confirmed using stainless steel hand K-files size #10 and #15. Working length was determined using an electronic apex locator and confirmed radiographically to be 1 mm shorter than radiographic apex. Mechanical preparation was done by crown-down technique using rotary Revo-S instruments and Ethylene Diamine Tetra Aceticacid gel as a lubricant. The canals were thoroughly irrigated using 3ml of 2.5% sodium hypochlorite following each instrument. After dryness of the canals using paper points, a cotton pellet was placed in the pulp chamber and the access cavity was sealed with a temporary filling. After 7 days, the root canals were obturated with lateral condensation technique using 0.04 taper gutta-percha and AdSeal resin-based root canal sealer.

Degree of postoperative pain was measured using visual analogue scale (VAS) after 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after instrumentation then at 6 and 12 hours after obturation. The VAS consists of a 10-cm line anchored by two extremes ""No pain"" and ""pain as bad as could be"". The patients were asked to choose the mark that represents their level of pain. Pain level was assigned to one of four categorical scores: 1, None(0); 2,Mild(1-3); 3,Moderate(4-6); 4,Severe(7-10) 10.

In case of moderate to severe postoperative pain, the patients were instructed to take a capsule of placebo given to him/her at the end of each visit.

Phosphatidylcholine is an important component of the phospholipids of the cell membranes. Citicoline is composed of two molecules: cyti¬dine and choline. Both these molecules enter the brain separately and by passing through the blood-brain barrier where they act as substrates for intracellular synthesis of CDP-choline . This drug has been widely used in adults who suffer from acute ischemic strokes for than 4 decades with good results and has been proved to have a very good safety profile as well. It has various therapeutic effects at several stages of the ischemic cascade in acute ischemic stroke.

1. It stabilizes cell membranes by increasing phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin synthesis and by inhibiting the release of free fatty acids . By protecting membranes, citicoline inhibits glutamate release during ischemia. In an experimental model of ischemia in the rat, citicoline treatment decreased glutamate levels and stroke size.
2. Citicoline favors the synthesis of nucleic acids, proteins, acetylcholine and other neurotransmitters, and decreases free radical formation Therefore, citicoline simultaneously inhibits different steps of the ischemic cascade protecting the injured tissue against early and delayed mechanisms responsible for ischemic brain injury.
3. citicoline may facilitate recovery by enhancing synaptic outgrowth and increased neuroplasticity with decrease of neurologic deficits and improvement of behavioral performance.

5832c6500d280f13,NCT02048046,Nutrition Therapy in Adult Patients Requiring ECMO in Australia and New Zealand,,,V3 110613,"Patients with heart and/or lung failure are some of the sickest patients in our hospital systems. In severe cases they often need long periods of specialist care in Intensive Care Units (ICU) in Australia and New Zealand. Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is an extremely specialised and costly form of life support, only being utilised when a patient is close to death as a last resort to save their life. This form of life support has been used for many years in babies and children but is relatively new for adults. Whilst there is evidence emerging of the positive effects of ECMO in adults, there is a lot that is unknown and further research is required.

Another essential therapy that assists patients in their recovery from illness is the provision of artificial nutrition. This liquid formula is delivered into the stomach or as a nutritionally rich fluid provided into the vein. Until recently nutrition was under-emphasised in the critically ill, however, it has now become clear that targeted nutrition can positively affect a person's outcome and is vital during long periods of intensive care hospitalisation.

There is very limited data on how nutrition affects the outcomes of ECMO patients (positive or negative). We know from limited studies that these patients receive less nutrition than other patients, something that is particularly concerning given that less nutrition leads to a longer hospital stay and has been linked a with higher hospital mortality. We also think that adult patients on ECMO need more nutrition as they appear to lose more weight than patients with other illnesses in intensive care; however this has not been confirmed. It is thus essential that we understand the effects of this relatively simple but vital therapy on these very sick patients.

This study proposes to collect information on the current feeding practices in patients on ECMO and describe the factors that inhibit or allow provision of nutrition so that we can understand the issues that exist, develop strategies to improve delivery of nutrition and determine areas for further research.","Aim

Our primary aims are to:

1. describe the current nutrition therapy practices and
2. profile the barriers and enablers to successful feeding in patients requiring VV (veno-venous) or VA (veno-arterial) ECMO whilst ECMO is insitu and for 7 days post ECMO removal.

Hypothesis We hypothesise that patients who receive VA or VV ECMO receive inadequate amounts of predicted nutrition requirements (including energy and protein) and are subject to frequent episodes of nutritional delivery interruption.

Study design A 12 month prospective, observational study in approximately 10 sites across Australia and New Zealand. Data will be collected from the commencement of ECMO until 7 days after its removal.

In addition, RA patients are at increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and premature death. The most effective pharmacological treatment is the use of biological agents that inhibit the action of specific substances, such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factors (TNF). Physical exercise is considered a first-line non-pharmacological treatment in RA, improving inflammatory and metabolic profile, functional capacity, fatigue and preventing the onset of CVD. There is evidence that IL-6, when secreted as a result of exercise, brings several benefits. However, there is no study investigating the interaction between biological IL-6 blocking agents and exercise on metabolic responses, such as insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake, in patients with RA. To answer this question, adult women diagnosed with RA and healthy controls will be recruited for an acute session of exercise. RA patients will be divided into 2 groups, according to the pharmacological treatment (tocilizumab or anti-TNF). The acute responses of insulin sensitivity after an acute session of exercise will be assessed by the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp, and the molecular pathways will be assessed by muscle biopsy and gene and protein expression analysis.

One study reported that patients with OSA have more atherosclerotic plaque burden in intravascular ultrasonography examination. Among patients who admitted with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 65.7% (69 of 105) patients were diagnosed with OSA. Other long-term follow-up study revealed that 45.4% of patients (594 of 1311) who performed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were diagnosed with OSA. Moreover, the OSA group was a significant independent predictor of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs).

Polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard for the diagnosis of OSA. But, PSG is expensive, time-consuming and difficult to perform immediately. Recently, a portable device named WATCH-PAT (Itamar Ltd, Israel) was developed for the diagnosis of OSA. Validation study demonstrated a high correlation between WATCH-PAT and PSG in apnea-hypopnea index, lowest oxygen saturation and sleep time. This result suggested WATCH-PAT can be performed as an alternative or supportive device of PSG. WATCH-PAT. The portable device also can be useful to detect OSA in bus drivers who can be the reason for public traffic accidents. Moreover, WATCH-PAT can be applied to assess postoperative improvement of OSA.

Although OSA is known as one of the risk factors for cardiovascular disease, there is a lack of evidence to recommend of the evaluation of sleep disorder in patient with coronary artery disease. Awareness and compliance for OSA are very low in both patients and cardiologists. Active diagnosis and treatment are definitely needed.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common and life-threatening complication in patients with liver cirrhosis, characterized by high incidence and mortality. The current diagnostic standard relies on ascitic fluid polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) count ≥250 cells/μL. However, this threshold is associated with high rates of missed diagnoses, poor correlation with clinical symptoms, and delays in pathogen identification due to the low sensitivity and prolonged time of traditional ascitic fluid culture.

With the development of molecular diagnostics, bacterial DNA (bactDNA) detection-especially through droplet digital PCR (ddPCR)-has emerged as a promising technique due to its high sensitivity, absolute quantification capability, and robustness. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic value and accuracy of ddPCR-based quantification of bacterial DNA in ascitic fluid for SBP, providing a novel and objective diagnostic tool to improve early and accurate detection and to inform targeted antimicrobial therapy.

Objectives:

To assess the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, predictive values) of ddPCR-based quantification of total bacterial DNA in ascitic fluid for SBP.

To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the ratio of Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacterial DNA (G+/G-) in predicting SBP.

To explore the potential of ddPCR-based bacterial DNA quantification as a complementary or alternative method to conventional PMN-based diagnostic criteria.

Study Design and Methods:

This is a prospective diagnostic study involving 700 patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites. Ascitic fluid samples will be analyzed using ddPCR to quantify bacterial DNA levels. These results will be compared with traditional diagnostic criteria, including PMN counts and expert panel assessments based on clinical symptoms and laboratory findings. Statistical analyses will include correlation analysis, ROC curve analysis, and consistency testing.

Expected Outcomes:

The study aims to establish the clinical efficacy of ddPCR-based quantification of bacterial DNA in ascitic fluid as a novel diagnostic marker for SBP. This method is expected to be particularly useful in atypical cases where PMN counts are \<250/μL and may help guide preliminary antibiotic selection based on the proportion of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, thereby reducing empirical treatment failures and antibiotic resistance.",,Beijing YouAn Hospital,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,OBSERVATIONAL,False,ESTIMATED,700.0,,,,,COHORT,PROSPECTIVE,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

c0efafd82245e497,NCT02869646,Acupuncture for PTSD,Acupuncture for PTSD in Combat Veterans,,CLNA-02-15F,"Current treatments for Veterans with PTSD include medications and therapy where the patient talks about traumatic events in order to desensitize to them. While these treatments work for many, a large minority of Veterans do not want medications or exposure therapy. The investigators developed an acupuncture (ACU) treatment for PTSD in order to broaden treatment options. The investigators' first study showed that it helped most people. However, the investigators need better scientific evidence that it works by comparing ACU to a placebo, such as ""sham"" acupuncture (fewer needles in non-important sites) and determining if ACU alters abnormal physiology in PTSD. In this study 90 Veterans will be randomly assigned (like a coin flip) to receive either ACU or sham. The investigators expect to find that the ACU treated patients have more improvement in PTSD and in physiology (less startle reaction - assessed non-invasively using skin sensors) than the patients in the sham group. This study will provide information to support the use of acupuncture for PTSD at the VA, which will expand treatment options.","Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is debilitating and common (up to 30% in Vietnam Veterans and 16% in Afghanistan and Iraq Veterans). A significant number of Veterans do not engage in or drop-out from effective trauma-focused therapies due to avoidance from trauma-related memories. Because of this limitation, and because scientific literature suggested that acupuncture might be effective for PTSD symptoms, the investigators developed an acupuncture intervention for PTSD and conducted a clinical trial that showed positive effects. This remains the only high quality trial of acupuncture for PTSD published, because of which the current VA/DoD guidelines for PTSD state that acupuncture is a ""B"" recommendation (fair evidence, provide service) for PTSD treatment. That civilian study compared acupuncture to an effective therapy (CBT) and a wait-list control, but did not have a placebo control. And, research has shown that Veterans may respond differently to therapies than civilians. More definitive data about the efficacy of acupuncture for PTSD is required in order to recommend it as an ""A"" evidence-based intervention for PTSD in Veterans. Specifically, it is important to show that acupuncture is better than a placebo control and that it has effects on biological abnormalities of PTSD. The aim of this study is to demonstrate efficacy of acupuncture for PTSD by showing clinical and biological effects that are statistically larger and clinically more important than effects of ""sham"" acupuncture. Given current knowledge and the need for efficient, ethical and best practices within an experimental design, the primary aim is best accomplished by a randomized controlled trial comparing verum acupuncture (ACU) to placebo minimal needling sham acupuncture (MIN). The goal is to evaluate ACU for a significant positive signal, not to compare ACU to other interventions or to evaluate treatment durability. Acupuncture is delivered in 24 sessions over 12 weeks. The primary hypothesis is that efficacy of ACU for PTSD symptom severity will be large (pre- to post-treatment Cohen's d \> 0.8), and significantly better than MIN (between group Cohen's d \> 0.30, with 80% probability of detecting a true group difference at p\<0.05 (2-sided). The secondary hypothesis is that compared to MIN, ACU will be associated with a significantly larger change from pre- to post-treatment in psychophysiological response (decreased startle by EMG eyeblink during fear conditioning procedure). The study design is a two-arm, parallel-group, prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT). The sample frame is Veterans with chronic PTSD with a sample of convenience from those seeking care at the Long Beach VA. Exclusion criteria are meant to keep out individuals with characteristics that are known to be PTSD treatment confounds, associated with non-adherence or negative response to treatment, that may significantly affect biological assessment, or who may be put at risk of harm. The sample size (90) provides adequate power to test hypotheses. Subjects will be allocated to intervention group by computer-generated adaptive randomization. General linear mixed models will be used to evaluate hypothesized effects over time (mid treatment, end of treatment, 1-month follow-up), controlling for baseline severity of symptoms and demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender) using intent-to-treat modeling. Outcome effect size (Cohen's d) within and between subjects will be calculated. Interaction terms will be included in the models to evaluate treatment fidelity and treatment expectancy as potential moderators. Study results will provide clinicians and policy makers with more information to make decisions about the rational use of acupuncture for PTSD. This is important because acupuncture is being touted for PTSD by many advocates. It has the potential to reach PTSD sufferers who are not willing to engage in trauma-focused psychotherapy, or for whom current therapies are ineffective.

When there is a threat to the body, the immune system triggers inflammation. Too much inflammation can damage the body or cause painful symptoms. Some people with HIV feel sick after they start HIV drugs because their recovering immune systems cause too much inflammation. Or their immune systems can become activated all the time. This can cause serious health problems. Researchers want to test if the drug CC-11050 helps treat inflammation in people taking HIV drugs.

Objectives:

To test if CC-11050 is safe and well-tolerated for people with HIV who are taking HIV drugs. To see if it reduces inflammation.

Eligibility:

People ages 18 and older with HIV who have been on antiretroviral therapy for at least 1 year.

Design:

Participants will be screened with:

Medicine review

Physical exam and medical history

Blood and urine tests

Chest x-ray

Electrocardiogram (ECG): Soft electrodes on the skin record heart signals.

Participants will be randomly assigned to take capsules of either CC-11050 or a placebo. They will take the capsules every day for 12 weeks. They will continue to take their HIV drugs.

Participants will have a baseline visit within 2 months of screening. This includes:

Physical exam and medical history

Blood and urine tests

ECG

Leukapheresis: Blood is removed by a needle in one arm and passed through a machine that removes white blood cells. The rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm.

Participants will have follow-up visits 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after the baseline visit. These may include repeats of some of the baseline tests.","CC-11050 is a novel anti-inflammatory compound with potential to treat a variety of chronic inflammatory conditions and cytokine storms associated with infectious diseases. CC-11050 is a selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor (PDE4) that is active in several in vivo models of inflammatory disease, inhibiting systemic TNF- production, colitis symptoms of the colon, psoriasiform features in the skin, arthritogenic swelling in the joints, neutrophilia and eosinophilia in the lung, and reducing choroidal neovascularization. These data suggest that CC-11050 may have therapeutic potential for chronic inflammatory conditions and/or as an antiangiogenic treatment. The safety profile of CC-11050 has been investigated in healthy males and in subjects with cutaneous lupus erythematosus; the most frequently reported adverse events were fatigue, headache, upper respiratory infection and pruritus; there were no deaths or serious adverse events.

Inflammation is an important contributor to HIV pathogenesis both prior to and after ART initiation. Inflammatory responses can occur abruptly upon ART initiation (known as immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome or IRIS) and can be chronic in persons with suppressed plasma HIV viremia who are treated with ART, and has been linked to an excess risk of non-AIDS serious events such as cardiovascular, liver and kidney disease and accelerated bone loss. Corticosteroids to reduce levels of inflammatory cytokines in plasma are a standard therapeutic intervention for IRIS, however a more targeted anti-inflammatory and less broadly immunosuppressive intervention is desirable.

We propose a double-blind, randomized trial to assess the safety of CC-11050 in adults with HIV infection who have taken ART for at least 1 year and have suppressed plasma viremia. Enrolled subjects will be randomized 2:1 to 200 mg CC-11050 or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. Participants will be evaluated at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 16. Changes in in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels (by clinical assay), CD4+ T cell counts and percentages, and the effect on markers of systemic inflammation (e.g., TNF, IL-6, CRP, IFNg, sCD14, D-dimer) will be measured.

Arterial line placement can be challenging, especially in the pediatric population. Frequently multiple attempts are required with relatively high failure rates. This can result in excessive needle punctures and extended OR times. A few studies have looked at the use of ultrasound to decrease OR time and increase success rates both in adult and pediatric populations. These studies compared the traditional palpation method with either short axis or long axis views of the vessel using ultrasound guidance. No study to date has compared short axis and long axis views for arterial line placement in either the pediatric or adult population. Our study compares success rates and OR times when long and short axis methods of arterial line insertion are employed in the pediatric population.","An Arterial line is an intraoperative monitor that is frequently placed in the pediatric population. Due to their smaller anatomy and more compliant skin, arterial lines can be more difficult to insert in the pediatric population than in adults. Additionally, lower perfusion pressure and larger subcutaneous adipose tissue can make pulse palpation more difficult. Ultrasound is a modality that can directly image the radial, ulnar, or brachial artery. Along with 2D ultrasound, doppler ultrasound can be utilized to confirm that an artery is not a vein. Once the vessel is identified, the vessel can be viewed in either the long or short access. The ultrasound beam is only 1 millimeter thick so a practitioner must stabilize the probe to view the vessel, especially in the long axis view. Once the artery is viewed in long axis, the needle can be directly visualized all the way into the vessel. Visualization of a guidewire or catheter in the vessel can confirm proper arterial access. In a short access ultrasound view, it is possible to see tissue movement and sometimes a hyperechoic (bright) dot which represents the needle. Tissue movement can help confirm the needle is immediately above the artery at all times. The advantage of the short axis view is that less precision is needed to hold and position the transducer than with the long axis view. The disadvantage of the short axis view is that the operator cannot see the tip of the angiocatheter as it enters the vessel. As a result, the proximal portion of the angiocatheter can be above the artery but the distal tip could be to the side of the artery.",University of Oklahoma,OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,29.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,TREATMENT,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Trientine hydrochloride can limit secondary inflammatory damage to retinal vessels following the administration of pan-retinal photocoagulation therapy for severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy or retinal neovascularization due to diabetic retinopathy, resulting in less macular edema and improved visual outcomes.","Individuals with new-onset severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy or retinal neovascularization who present to the retinal service of the UBC/VGH Eye Care Centre will be offered participation in this study. Subject inclusion criteria will parallel those of the DRS (Diabetic Retinopathy Study) and ETDRS (Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study). One PRP session will consist of between 800 to 1000 laser burns. Subjects with discomfort during laser (a known side-effect) will be treated with local anesthetics.

As noted, participating subjects will all receive PRP according to present standards of care; however, subjects will be randomized to either a 10-day course of oral Trientine at 1500mg administered for 7-days prior to and 3 days after the PRP sessions, or a placebo. Serum copper levels and urinary copper levels will be evaluated before and after Trientine administration to determine the amount of free copper present systemically at the time of PRP treatment.

Ocular outcomes will include visual acuity testing (ETDRS), fluorescein angiography and ocular coherence tomography (OCT). These studies will be used to evaluate retinal morphology and photoreceptor function pre and post laser. All these evaluations are considered part of the routine evaluation of diabetic retinopathy in subjects being treated with PRP.

Outcome measures will be assessed at day 2-post laser, week 1, and Day 28-30. Further clinical PRP treatment will be administered if necessary after Day 28-30 at the discretion of the patients' ophthalmologist.

The primary analysis will involve comparing the retinal thickness measurements between subjects undergoing PRP with and without Trientine use. Secondary analyses will involve evaluations of visual acuity and fluorescein angiography. As well, changes in visual acuity, angiographic leakage, and retinal thickness will be regressed against serum copper levels.

c31c63385c22f7a3,NCT02361788,Study on Newborn Babies With a Yellow Skin Color (Neonatal Jaundice Study),A Prospective Cohort Study on the Etiology of Neonatal Hyperbilirubinemia in a Migrant and Refugee Population on the Thai-Myanmar Border,,SMRU 1307,"Background: Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is the most common reason for admission in the neonatal period (first month of life) worldwide and at SMRU. The skin of the newborn baby becomes jaundiced, which is caused by a high level of bilirubin in the blood. In some neonates the level of bilirubin increases to a level that can cause braindamage or even death. There are different causes known that can lead to higher levels of bilirubin, for example G6PD deficiency and prematurity. In case of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia the neonate needs to be treated with phototherapy (blue light therapy). If there is prolonged jaundice (≥ 21 days), further investigations needs to be done.

Objectives:

Primary objective:

To determine the etiology of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in neonates with a gestational age of ≥ 28 weeks from the refugee and migrant population, on the Thai-Myanmar border.

Secondary objective:

* Establishing the incidence of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia
* Determine the risk factors for the development of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia
* Determine the incidence of prolonged neonatal jaundice
* Determine the neurodevelopmental outcome, at the age of 6 and 12 months
* Determine the body composition, using air-displacement plethysmography, at birth, 1, 2 and 3 months of age
* Determine the incidence of anaemia and illness episodes during the first year of life
* Determine the incidence of helminthic infection at the age of one year
* Assess the knowledge level and misbeliefs on neonatal hyperbilirubinemia among the mothers and SMRU health care staff

Research design: The study will conduct an exhaustive prospective descriptive study, all eligible newborns will be enrolled after obtaining the informed consent from their mothers. During pregnancy and delivery we will collect clinical data about the mother. At birth we will take umbilical cord blood (9 ml) to test for different causes of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. In the first week of life we plan 4 moments to measure the bilirubin and hematocrit level (0.05 ml), weight and ask questions about feeding and other practices. Based on the bilirubin results we will determine whether the neonate needs phototherapy. After the first week we weekly follow-up will be conducted and in case of visible jaundice we will measure the bilirubin level. If the neonate is still jaundiced after the age of 21 days we will further investigate the cause. In the infant period, until the age of one year, we plan to have monthly follow-up to assess the health and growth of the child and at the age of 3, 6 and 12 months we will do a neurodevelopmental test.

An improved understanding of the pathological processes contributing to the development of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is needed in order to to identify neonates at risk and develop improved management.","PROCEDURES DURING PREGNANCY

During the first antenatal care visit the mother will have a gestational dating ultrasound to determine the accurate gestational age. During all antenatal care visits information about the mother will be collected as part of standard obstetric care:

* Ethnicity
* Age
* Medical history

  * Blood transfusion in history
  * Chronic diseases
* Obstetric history

  * Parity and gravida
  * Previous neonatal deaths and reason of death
  * Previous preterm delivery
  * Previous child with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia
* Pregnancy

  * Gestational dating ultrasound
  * Obstetric problems
  * Malaria and morbidity episodes during pregnancy
  * BMI, MUAC and weightgain
  * Laboratory results

    * Hepatitis B status\*
    * HIV status\*
    * Syphilis serology\*
    * G6PD status
    * Hemoglobinopathy
    * ABO blood group
    * Rhesus D blood group

Testing for STD and HIV is routine practice at the SMRU clinics. Before the screening permission from the mother is requested. Life-long antiretroviral triple therapy is available in case of a positive HIV test.

To assess the knowledge and beliefs on neonatal jaundice among the mothers we will perform a short questionnaire. This questionnaire will help the study team to assess the level of knowledge and the misbeliefs on neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. The study team will also ask the subjects about the use of naphthalene containing moth balls and explain them the danger in case the subject's baby will be G6PD deficient.

PROCEDURES AT BIRTH

Eligibility:

At birth the neonate will be excluded if the gestational age is \< 28 weeks.

Questionnaire:

Detailed data about the delivery will be collected:

* Duration of maternal membrane rupture before delivery
* Mode of delivery
* Presence of maternal fever in labour and use of antibiotics
* Use of oxytocin
* Complications
* Gestational age

  * Confirmed by ultrasound if presenting \< 24 weeks (CRL \< 14 weeks, HC 14-23+6) or, in case of late ultrasound, determined with the Dubowitz gestational age assessment (performed 6-72 hours after birth)
* Apgar score and need for resuscitation
* Gender

Laboratory Investigations:

Umbilical cord blood will be obtained for laboratory investigations as below;

ABO and Rhesus D blood group 0.1 ml., G6PD fluorescent test 0.005 ml., G6PD spectrophotometric assay 0.05 ml., G6PD flow cytometric assay 0.05 ml., Coomb's test (Direct Antiglobulin Test) 3 ml., Albumin 3 ml., Genotyping (G6PD, SAO, UGT1A1 mutations) 2 ml.,

Total volume 8.205 ml (For practical reason we will take 9 ml.)

Clinical assessment:

Birthweight, length and head circumference will be determined. The body composition will be measured using air-displacement plethysmography (PeaPod) . A newborn physical examination (including vital signs) will be performed within the first 24 hours, as part of normal neonatal care:

Observations:

* skin colour (pale/cyanosed/jaundiced/normal),
* skin rash
* description of anterior fontanelle (raised/normal/depressed),
* bruising on the body: location
* swelling on the head

  * 2 diameters will be measured
  * swelling crossing the scalp sutures
  * diagnose: caput succedaneum, cephalhematoma or subgaleal hemorrhage
* abnormality of the face
* abnormality of palate, mouth
* abnormality of limbs, fingers or toes

Cardiovascular examination: heart rate(per minute), heart sounds, femoral pulses

Respiratory examination: respiratory rate (per minute), lung sounds, signs of respiratory distress (chest indrawing/nasal flaring/head bobbing)

Abdominal examination: abdominal mass, enlarged liver or spleen, genitalia, anus

Neurological examination: muscle tone, moving of limbs, eye red reflex

PROCEDURES DURING NEONATAL FOLLOW-UP In the first week after birth there are four moments when the neonate will be assessed. This will be 24 hours \[range 22-26 hours\], 48 hours \[range 36-60 hours\], 84 hours \[range 70-96 hours\] and on day 6 \[range day 5-8\]. After this week the mother will be asked to come back for weekly follow-up until the age of one month. At one month of age the body composition will be measured using PeaPod.

Questionnaire:

The mother will be asked questions:

First 24 hours after delivery:

* Age (in hours) of initiation of feeding
* Feeding:

  * How is the baby being fed (exclusive breastmilk, supplementary or mixed feeding)
  * If supplementary feeding, what is the reason for this?
  * Does the baby suck well?
* Use of drugs or herbal medicine by mother in first 24 hours
* Use of herbal preparations for neonate
* Age (in hours) at passage of first stool and urine
* Use of napthalene balls for storing of baby clothes

During every follow-up the mother the questions about feeding will be repeated.

Laboratory Investigations:

During every neonatal follow-up until the visit on day 6 \[range day 5-8\], a SBR and haematocrit will be measured. The SBR result will be plotted, by age on a jaundice treatment graph specific for the gestational age and the need for phototherapy or more intense follow-up will be determined. During weekly follow-up after the age of 8 days, only a SBR and hematocrit will be measured in case of visible jaundice. At the age of one month, a hematocrit will be measured for anemia screening and the G6PD fluorescent test will be repeated as below.

Serum bilirubin 0.05 ml. x 5, Haematocrit 0.05 ml. x 5, G6PD fluorescent test 0.005 ml.

Total 0.205 ml.

Clinical assessment:

A physical examination (including vital signs) will be performed at every visit and the weight will be measured. Weightloss or -increase will be calculated and if there is ≥ 10% weightloss, the neonate will be reviewed carefully for any underlying cause of this weightloss and supplementary feeding (expressed breastmilk or powdermilk) will be started.

PROCEDURES WHEN DELIVERY OUTSIDE SMRU

In case of delivery in another clinic or at home, but the mother and neonate visit a SMRU clinic within the first 48 hours after delivery, the neonate can still be included in the study.

If a neonate is born outside SMRU and does not visit the clinic within 48 hours after delivery, but presents with neonatal hyperbilirubinemia in the first 8 days of life, this neonate can be included in the study as well. Because no umbilical cord blood was taken, a limited set of laboratory investigations will be performed, as described as below;.

ABO and Rhesus D bloodgroup 0.075 ml., G6PD fluorescent test 0.005 ml., G6PD spectrophotometric assay 0.05 ml., G6PD flow cytometric assay 0.05 ml., Serum bilirubin 0.05 ml., Haematocrit 0.05 ml., Genotyping 2 ml.,

Total volume 2.23 ml.

PROCEDURES DURING INFANT FOLLOW-UP

Infant follow-up will take place every month until the age of 12 months.

Questionnaire:

At every visit the mother will be asked about feeding practices and after the age of 6 months about neurodevelopmental milestones.

Laboratory investigations:

Due to the problems of anaemia in this population (50% of the infants are reported to have a haematocrit of \< 33% at the age of 6 months; personal communication Dr. Rose McGready) haematocrit will be measured monthly, by finger prick, and anaemia will be treated if necessary. At the age of one year a stool test for parasitology screening will be taken and the infant will be treated if necessary. Finally at one year of age the infant will be screened for hemoglobinopathy due to contradictory reports of the association between neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and hemoglobinopathy as below:

Haematocrit 0.05 ml. x11, Hemoglobin typing 3 ml.

Total volume 3.55 ml.

Clinical assessment:

A physical examination (including vital signs) will be performed at every visit and the weight will be measured. At the age of 2 and 3 month a body composition will be measured using PeaPod. At 3, 6, 9 and 12 months the length and head circumference will be measured.

At the age of 3, 6 months and 12 months the infant will be assessed with the Shoklo Developmental Test 53 and the results compared to age specific norms developed for this population.

Summary of results:

Population risks for neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia (NH) vary. Knowledge of local risks permits interventions that may reduce the proportion becoming severe. Between January 2015 and May 2016, in a resource-limited setting on the Thailand-Myanmar border, neonates from 28 weeks' gestation were enrolled into a prospective birth cohort. Each neonate had total serum bilirubin measurements: scheduled (24, 48, 72 and 144 hours of life) and clinically indicated; and weekly follow up until 1 month of age. Risk factors for developing NH were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard mixed model. Of 1710 neonates, 22% (376) developed NH (83% preterm, 19% term). All neonates born \<35 weeks, four in five born 35- 37 weeks, and three in twenty born \>38 weeks had NH, giving an overall incidence of 249 per 1000 livebirths \[95%CI 225, 403\]. Mortality from acute bilirubin encephalopathy was 10% (2/20) amongst the 5.3% (20/376) who reached the severe NH threshold. One-quarter (26.3%) of NH occurred within 24 hours. NH onset varied with gestational age: at a median \[IQR\] 24 hours \[24, 30\] for neonates born 37 weeks or prematurely vs 59 hours \[48, 84\] for neonates born \>38 weeks. Risk factors for NH in the first week of life independent of gestational age were: neonatal G6PD deficiency, birth bruising, Sgaw Karen ethnicity, primigravidae, pre-eclampsia, and prolonged rupture of membranes. The genetic impact of G6PD deficiency on NH was partially interpreted by using the florescent spot test and further genotyping work is in progress. The risk of NH in Sgaw Karen refugees may be overlooked internationally as they are most likely regarded as Burmese in countries of resettlement. Given high levels of pathological jaundice in the first 24 hours and overall high NH burden, guidelines changes were implemented including preventive PT for all neonates \<35 weeks and for those 35-37 weeks with risk factors.

FST was performed on 1521 umbilical cord blood samples. Quality control and genotyping revealed 10 misdiagnoses. After quality control, 10.7% of the males (84/786) and 1.2% of the females (9/735) were phenotypically G6PD deficient at birth. The FST repeated at one month of age or later diagnosed 8 additional G6PD deficient infants who were phenotypically normal at birth.

Lower gestational age (\<38 weeks), mutations in the genes encoding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and uridine 50-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 were identified as the main independent risk factors for NH in the first week, and for prolonged jaundice in the first month of life. Population attributable risks (PAR%) were 61.7% for lower gestational age, 22.9% for hemi or homozygous and 9.9% for heterozygous G6PD deficiency respectively, and 6.3% for UGT1A1\*6 homozygosity. In neonates with an estimated gestational age ≤38 weeks, G6PD mutations contributed PARs of 38.1% and 23.6% for ""early"" (≤48 hours) and ""late"" (49-168 hours) NH respectively. For late NH, the PAR for UGT1A1\*6 homozygosity was 7.7%. Maternal excess weight was also a significant risk factor for ""early"" NH while maternal mutations on the beta-globin gene, prolonged rupture of membranes, large haematomas and neonatal sepsis were risk factors for ""late"" NH. For prolonged jaundice during the first month of life, G6PD mutations and UGT1A1\*6 mutation, together with lower gestational age at birth and presence of haematoma were significant risk factors.

Conclusions:

In this resource-limited setting with a dedicated special baby care unit but not intensive care nor timely access to exchange transfusion, this epidemiological study identified a high NH prevalence, 1 in 4 developing within 24 hours of life. Active screening likely lowered severe case incidence but mortality due to encephalopathy was still 1 in 10, and this is probably an underestimate. Guidelines were modified towards early NH identification and treatment and adequate follow up of those at risk of late NH. Sgaw Karen have the highest risk of NH according to ethnicity but are internationally known as Burmese refugees. The increased risk of NH in neonates identified as G6PD deficient by fluorescent spot test most likely underestimate the risk in female neonates and further research is currently evaluating this. This study demonstrates that mortality and potentially crippling morbidity from severe NH can be managed in a resource limited setting that can provide screening for TSB and offer phototherapy based on guidelines.

This study shows the short-comings of the G6PD FST in neonatal routine screening and highlights the importance of training and quality control.

In this population, genetic factors contribute considerably to the high risk of NH.

Technology advancements made it possible to supplement infant formulas with HMOs (2'FL, LNnT). Two published RCTs have demonstrated that infant formulas supplemented with 2'FL or 2'FL+LNnT are safe, well-tolerated, support normal grow, and may support healthy GI function and confer immune benefits. The performance of HMOs-supplemented formulas assessed in a real-world setting is complementary to previously conducted RCTs conducted in highly controlled clinical settings. Main objectives will be to monitor the safety \& tolerance of HMOs-supplemented formulas in larger and diverse infant populations; to assess the performance of HMOs-supplemented formulas in mixed-fed infants, a population that was not studied in previous RCTs but likely represents a relatively common feeding regimen. Finally, considering the potential health/immune benefits of HMOs, it is also important explore the incidences of illnesses (i.e., respiratory illnesses, GI illnesses, and fever) associated with consuming HMOs-supplemented formulas and compare with breastfed infants data.","Objectives:

The main objective of this study is to document the growth and feeding tolerance of healthy term infants consuming an infant formula supplemented with HMOs for 8 weeks (56 days), in a real-world setting.

Numerous biomarkers have been evaluated in the recent literature as being altered in patients with severe forms of COVID-19. Particularly, in the critical care area, the research of early predictors of mortality is essential for high-flow management of patients requiring invasive assisted ventilation and requiring invasive and non-invasive assisted ventilation, hemodynamic support, sometimes extracorporeal support (Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation, ECMO). The coordinated study of different biomarkers, in particular, if combined with each other, possibly even to constitute a possible score, could guide the correct allocation of patients between hospital departments and the appropriate management in intensive care units. appropriate management in intensive care units, as well as providing an early prognostic indication. prognostic indication. The combination of these biomarkers with routine clinical and laboratory data may further provide valuable information about their use in acute care and as progressive acute and as progressive monitoring over time.

Thus, despite tremendous advances in vitreoretinal surgery and management of rhegmatogenous RD leading to a primary reattachment rate over 95%, some patients show poor visual recovery because of photoreceptor apoptosis.

Physiologically, microglial cells (resident macrophages) are present only in the inner retina. The subretinal space, located between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the photoreceptor outer segments (POS), is devoid of all mononuclear phagocytes and form a zone of immune privilege. In AMD, several studies showed a strong association between subretinal mononuclear phagocytes infiltration and advanced forms of AMD. Experimental work in mice suggest that this infiltration plays an important role in the pathogenesis of this condition by producing inflammatory cytokines.

Methods: In this prospective, open-label, controlled, multi-clinical trial, 8702 individuals from primary care clinics were screened for penicillin allergy. 169 patients with a history of non-life threatening allergic reaction to penicillin, dating back at least 3 years, were recruited for study. Regardless of the response to penicillin skin testing, patients received the recommended daily dosage of penicillin and amoxicillin on two separate occasions. 2-6 years later a follow-up was conducted to assess the outcomes of further penicillin administration.

Results: 92.9% of the patients had an allergic reaction 6 years or longer before enrollment in the study.

The treatment usually involves hormonal stimulation of the ovaries by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), followed by surgical removal of eggs which are then mixed with sperm in the laboratory to create embryos. The success rates of IVF treatment remain unsatisfactory and are no longer increasing. One of the reasons is an adverse effect of high serum estradiol levels following FSH stimulation on the lining of the uterus.

Letrozole is a drug used in the prevention of recurrence of breast cancer because of its action to reduce the intra-ovarian aromatization of androgens to estrogens. It is now increasingly used for ovulation induction and is as safe as clomiphene citrate. Use of letrozole during standard ovarian stimulation for IVF producing adequate numbers of oocytes with physiological levels of estradiol may increase the present success rate of standard IVF treatment.

The aim of this randomized study is to compare the live birth rate of FSH alone versus combined FSH and letrozole used for ovarian stimulation in IVF treatment.","Trial design:

Infertile women undergoing IVF treatment will be randomized into one of the following two groups by an online randomization program:

Letrozole group: letrozole 2.5mg daily will be given at the start of the antagonist during ovarian stimulation i.e. day 5 of stimulation.

Control group: standard care with FSH alone during ovarian stimulation.

Intervention:

Subjects can be put on oral contraceptive pill in the preceding cycle for scheduling stimulation. On day 2-3, a pelvic ultrasound will be performed for antral follicle count.

Letrozole group:

Daily 150-225 IU human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG) / Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) from cycle day 2-4 (at least 5 days after stopping the oral contraceptive pill) and co-treatment with letrozole 2.5 mg daily from stimulation day 5 until the day before hCG administration. GnRH antagonist (cetrotide or orgalutran) 0.25 mg daily from stimulation day 5 until the day of hCG administration.

Control group:

Daily 150-225 IU HMG/FSH cycle day 2-4 (at least 5 days after stopping the oral contraceptive pill) until the day before hCG administration. GnRH antagonist 0.25 mg daily from stimulation day 5 until the day of hCG administration.

A blood sample will be taken and analyzed in the local laboratory for serum E2, P and testosterone levels on cycle day 2 or 3 (baseline) and day of hCG (or the day before). The remaining serum will be frozen and stored for later analysis.

A sample of follicular fluid (FF) will be collected from the first blood free follicle. The FF will be frozen and stored for later analysis: Estradiol, testosterone, inhibin B and AMH levels.

All techniques of IVF including harvesting of oocytes, insemination with specially prepared sperm, embryo culture in the laboratory, embryo transfer and luteal phase support will be according to local protocols. One or two embryos or blastocysts will be replaced.

A pregnancy test will be carried out 2 weeks after embryo transfer in both arms. All women who have a positive pregnancy test 2 weeks after embryo transfer will undergo a transvaginal ultrasound scan to identify the presence and number of gestation sac with a fetal heart signifying an ongoing pregnancy.

Primary efficacy parameter will be response rate (CR and PR) according to RECIST criteria.

Secondary endpoints will be duration of response, progression free survival and overall survival. Toxicity will also be evaluated.","Ovarian cancer is the sixth most common malignancy in women, with estimated 2500 cases diagnosed in 2001, and 1500 deaths. Despite maximal cytoreductive therapy, followed normally by a taxane and carboplatin (or cisplatin) chemotherapy, most patients will relapse, and require chemotherapy in a palliative setting. The goal of this second line therapy is to prolong survival and to improve quality of life. This disease has been characterized as chronic, as many patients may eventually go on to respond to additional lines of therapy.

Response to second line therapy has been correlated to length of time since the end of the first line treatment (treatment free interval, TFI). Patients relapsing or progressing while on therapy are defined as platinum-refractory. In North America the norm is to label patients with a TFI of 6 months or less as platinum-resistant. A TFI of greater than 6 months would make a patient platinum-sensitive.

These platinum-sensitive patients are generally treated with single agent carboplatin or carboplatin and taxol by 3-weekly administration. The ICON-4 trial published in June 2003 compared single agent platinum to combination of platinum-taxol. Patients could have received one or both of these agents in the adjuvant setting. At a median follow-up of 42 months the absolute difference in 2-year survival was 7% \[P=0.0004} in favor of the combination arm. Thus combination platinum-taxol is the present standard of care in platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. Use of taxol is limited by persistent neuropathy in 20%.

Presently there is growing evidence in support of giving chemotherapy at shorter intervals at low-doses. Hypothetically, this allows less advancement of cancer cells through the cell cycle. Moreover weekly taxanes are associated with an anti-angiogenic effect- more so with taxotere than taxol in cell-lines.

Several randomized trials in breast cancer have shown the improved efficacy of weekly taxol over 3-weekly taxol. The neoadjuvant study showed an increase in pCR \[complete response on pathologic evaluation\] of 10%with weekly taxol. The adjuvant study with 2-weekly chemotherapy showed a 7% improvement in time-to-progression over 3-weekly chemotherapy.

In ovarian cancer- a Phase II study of weekly carboplatin (AUC-2) with taxol (80mg/m2/week) given on day 1,8,15 of 28 day cycles has shown a response rate of 100% \[80% CR, 20% PR\] in 21 platinum-sensitive patients- with either measurable or evaluable disease. Median duration of response was 11.7 months (95% CI- 8.0-18.5 months). 46% reported Grade I neuropathy, 1 patient had febrile neutropenia, and 32% had Grade 3 neutropenia.

Weekly administration of taxotere with carboplatin has been studied in a Phase I study. Maximum tolerated dose was Taxotere 35mg/m2 with carboplatin AUC-2. At this dose no Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias were seen. Nor were there significant neuropathies.

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of renal denervation in patients with Chagas heart disease, due to reduction in renal and systemic sympathetic activity.","The activation of the sympathetic nervous system is one of the main mechanisms involved in heart failure pathophysiology, as well as activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. These compensatory mechanisms are initially beneficial, in order to restore adequate cardiac output. Their long-term activation, nevertheless, leads to several deleterious effects on cardiovascular system, such as direct myocite lesion, cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial ischemia, oxidative stress, cardiac arrhythmias and myocite apoptosis, among others.

It has been widely demonstrated that modulation of sympathetic nervous system is an important therapeutic target for the treatment of systolic heart failure. Beta-blocker and ACE inhibitors therapies are the main stem of heart failure treatment and have demonstrated reduction in morbidity and mortality of this condition. Despite optimized medical treatment, heart failure carries a poor prognosis.

Surgical sympathectomy has been used decades ago for the treatment of malignant hypertension and showed marked reduction in arterial pressure. However, these procedures were very aggressive and lead to long hospitalization and recovery periods, as well as several limiting adverse effects. Recently, transcatheter renal denervation has evolved as a promising and less invasive technique, which allows destruction of renal nerves located on the adventitia of the renal arteries. The ablation procedure is performed by delivery of radiofrequency energy from the tip of a catheter positioned into the renal arteries, through standard femoral artery catheterization, a less morbid and safer approach.

Renal denervation has been tested mainly in patients with resistant hypertension, among other indications, with promising results. The pathophysiological basis for this treatment in hypertension, as well as heart failure, stands on the participation of renal afferent and efferent nerves on the maintenance of elevated systemic vascular resistance. Activation of efferent nerves leads to excretion o renin, aldosterone, angiotensin II, elevated norepinephrine levels and consequent retention of salt and water and reduction of renal blood flow. This mechanism and also afferent renal nerves activation contributes to the elevation of sympathetic tonus on the central nervous system.

In animal models of heart failure, renal denervation demonstrated improvement on renal and cardiac function. Initial clinical studies suggest that this intervention is safe and potentially effective on the treatment of heart failure in humans. Chagas heart disease is a prevalent cause of heart failure in Brazil and shares several pathophysiological aspects described for other causes of heart failure.

Participants receive adalimumab or placebo for 12 weeks during the double-blind phase of the study. Following the double-blind phase, all remaining participants enter the open-label phase of the study in which they receive open-label adalimumab for up to 144 weeks. Efficacy endpoints include the Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS) response criteria for patients with SpA. These response criteria were used to determine participants who were responders. ASAS response involves evaluations in the following 4 domains: participant's global assessment of disease activity, pain, function, and inflammation. The patient's global assessment of disease activity score is assessed using a 100 millimeter (mm) visual analog scale (VAS; 0 for no disease activity to 100 for severe disease activity). Pain is represented as a total back pain score and is assessed using a 100 mm VAS (0 for no pain to 100 for most severe pain). Function score is represented as the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) Functional Index (BASFI) 100 mm VAS score (average of the ability to perform 10 activities, each scored as 0 for easy to 100 for impossible). Inflammation is determined using the morning stiffness overall level score (0 for none to 10 for very severe) and duration score (0 for 0 hours to 10 for ≥ 2 hours) of the Bath AS Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) (mean of these items #5 and #6 scores). In addition, the BASDAI is used as an efficacy endpoint. The BASDAI is used by the participant to assess his/her disease activity. Using VAS scales, the participant answers 6 questions pertaining to symptoms experienced over the past week. For 5 questions (levels of: fatigue/tiredness; AS neck, back, or hip pain; pain/swelling; discomfort at areas tender to touch or pressure; and morning stiffness), the response scale is 0 (none) to 10 (very severe).

So, appropriate monitoring can be the gold standard in management of TBI. ICP can be measured by invasive and noninvasive methds. One of these noninvasive methods is bedside measurement of optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) by ocular ultrasonography","In the previous few years, agreat evidence has established for efficiency of dexmedetomidine (DEX) in management of TBI. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha-2 receptor agonist, its major sympatholytic and sedative actions are mediated primarily via reduced transmission in the locus coeruleus which is a part of the reticular activating system. It provides excellent sedation without respiratory depression, ease of arousability, and need not be stopped during weaning the patient from mechanical ventilation or for neurological assessment. It suits as an ideal sedative agent for patients with TBI. DEX has been shown to reduce cerebral ischemia/ reperfusion injury by suppressing inflammation, activating the anti-apoptotic signaling pathways, and inhibiting neuronal autophagy. Animal studies have shown that alpha-2 agonists are neuroprotective in craniocerebral and subarachnoid injuries but this has not been definitively shown in humans .

Outcomes: The results for the mean gingival thickness (GT), keratinized tissue width (kTW), pocket depth (PD), and gingival index (GI) at baseline, 1 month, 3 months and after 6 months","Research objective: The aim of conducting this research is development of newer, less invasive therapeutic approaches that help in prevention of gingival recession. As thin gingival biotype is more prone to gingival recession and to achieve satisfactory therapeutic results with minimum trauma to tissues of any interventional process.

Research Procedure in brief:

This study will be carried out on patients enrolled from the Outpatient Clinic of Oral Medicine and Periodontology department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University.

General operative procedures

* The patients who fulfil the inclusion criteria will be enrolled. The nature of the study will be explained to each patient as well as the importance of compliance with pre- and post-operative instructions and follow-up visits.
* Each patient will be asked to sign an informed consent (appendix 1)
* After enrolment, periodontal examination and measurement of periodontal probing depth (PD), patients with a high periodontal probe visibility in the anterior teeth will be identified. These patients will undergo gingival thickness (GT) measurement using trans gingival probing technique in the anterior teeth, and those with a measured GT of ≤ 1.5mm will be diagnosed with thin phenotype.
* The methods used for evaluation of gingival thickness included Visual assessment with aid of probe and direct measurement by #15 endodontic spreader will be inserted trans gingivally into the anaesthetized selected site (anaesthetized with Lidocaine 10% spray), stopper will be used as the reference point and the exact measurement will be recorded with the help of endo-ruler or caliber.
* Keratinized tissue width will be measured from gingival margin to mucogingival junction with the help of calibrated periodontal probe (UNC 15 probe).
* As a preliminary routine, supragingival scaling will be performed and oral hygiene instructions will be provided by the dental hygienist. We subsequently will schedule the procedure and perform it aseptically.
* The area to be injected will be anesthetized. To microneedle the gingival mucosa, we will use a derma pen device model M8 with 24 microneedles arranged in rows, which will be adjusted with 1.5 mm depth at the 6th mode speed of 700 cycles/min. The derma pen will be used in intermittent motion on the sextant gingival area for 30-40 seconds/tooth. When bleeding pinpoints observed on all areas of attached gingiva, the gingival mucosa will be irrigated with a saline solution and sterile gauze will be applied to dry the area.
* Intervention group: Vitamin C injection will be injected with microneedle at two points for each site in the attached gingiva of one site of the jaw either the left or the right side and the other side will be injected with injectable platelets rich fibrin (i-PRF) as a control group at 3 mm apical to the free gingival margin in the facial side of the tooth until the blanching of the gingiva will be seen and apical to the mucogingival junction. The treated area will be left without dressing. The patient will be instructed to refrain from drinking acidic or hot beverages for 24 hours and to not brush the teeth of the injected area for one day to avoid any mechanical trauma to the gingiva. Following the procedure, neither mouthwashes nor medications will be prescribed.
* Control group:

  1. Preparation and administration of injectable platelets rich fibrin (i-PRF): After collection of 5 ml of peripheral blood from each patient, blood will be transferred to a glass coated plastic vacutainer tube without anticoagulant. Then this tube will immediately centrifuged at 700 rpm for 3 mins \[Centrifuge Machine 5000rpm\]. After centrifugation, two fluid layers will formed, upper being yellow fluid layer (i-PRF) while lower layer containing red blood cells. Yellow fluid layer containing i-PRF will be immediately aspirated using micro needle.
  2. I-PRF will be injected on the site with thin gingival phenotype on the other side of the jaw in the same patient (split mouth technique) with micro needling with derma pen at two points for each site in the attached gingiva at 3 mm apical to the free gingival margin in the facial side of the tooth until the blanching of the gingiva was seen and apical to the mucogingival junction.
  3. Vitamin C and I-PRF will again be injected at the same site after 1 week and after 2 weeks from the baseline final injection which will be given.

Symbiofilm® has in vitro antibiofilm activity and protects in vitro human nasal epithelial cells viability after Rhinovirus, Adenovirus, coronavirus OC43 and flu infection.

Healsea® Babykids is a nasal spray indicated in children above 2 years to clean and moisten the nose during colds and rhinitis.

The common cold is an acute viral infection of the upper respiratory tract, involving, to variable degrees, sneezing, nasal congestion and discharge (rhinorrhea), sore throat, cough, low-grade fever, headache, and malaise. Acute viral rhinitis is generally self-limiting. In children where the illness is not self-limiting and extends beyond 7-10 days, many agree that a bacterial infection is likely. Bacterial over infections and progression to a chronic state are favoured by the formation of biofilms, which facilitate bacterial growth and persistence as well as reducing antibiotic efficacy.

The aim of this study is to demonstrate that Healsea® Babykids alleviates symptoms of the acute rhinitis phase with better efficacy than isotonic saline solution used as Placebo.

The study comprises 2 parts:

\- Part 1 (Day 1-Day 11): treatment of the acute phase

An investigation has been conducted to assess the efficacy of virtual reality games that enhance hand motor functions to attain long-lasting improvements. Patients were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. Each patient's therapy consists of 24 sessions, with each session lasting 4 days per week, for a total duration of 6 weeks. Developed four VR-based hand games that include hitting a rolling ball, grasping a balloon, swapping hands, and gripping a pencil.","The field of stroke rehabilitation frequently faces limitations in therapies and struggles to achieve long-lasting improvements in hand motor function. The integration of fully immersive virtual reality (VR) games with visual training feedback significantly improves the efficacy of stroke rehabilitation. Virtual reality (VR) games that incorporate repetitive and particular tasks stimulate the gradual activation of brain pathways linked to motor activities. VR research has the potential to enhance VR intervention games by combining cognitive engagement with visual feedback.

The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate virtual reality games that utilize an approach of cognitive engagement within visual feedback in order to enhance hand-motor capabilities. The study utilized completely immersive virtual reality (VR) games specifically designed for subacute stroke patients.

Most of the patients with DPN did not complain about their symptoms because of without prominent symptoms. DPN is the major complication of diabetes. According to the international studies, DPN has the hidden epidemic and is the common causes which can lead to disability and decreased the quality of life in diabetes. Therefore, the study focused on the prevalence of DPN and its impact on the ADLs is obligatory as the descriptive study to explore the actual situation.

Nursing care is not only for the patients in the hospital but also for the people in the community. Moreover, the nurses have to focus on all levels of prevention.

In PCI settings all therapies inhibiting coagulation and primary hemostasis may limit ischaemic event rates, but are associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Retrospective and registry data indicates that haemorrhage is associated with mortality in patients undergoing PCI, emphasizing the potential importance of minimizing bleeding, as well as ischemic events, bleeding has now emerged as one of the most common complication of PCI. Major bleeding and blood transfusion have been strongly associated with increased rates of in-hospital and late mortality, MI and repeat revascularization after PCI. Also minor bleeding, although represent a complication significantly less dangerous than major haemorrhages, are associated with prolonged hospitalization, increased cost and adversely affect short- and long-term outcome.

UFH is the most commonly used anticoagulant drug during PCI. Bleeding events during PCI may be in part due to the use of this drug. Bivalirudin (The Medicine's Co., Parsippany, NJ) is a synthetic direct thrombin inhibitor approved for patients with stable and unstable coronary syndromes undergoing PCI. Favourable properties of bivalirudin may minimize bleeding.

Several clinical and procedural factors have been evaluated to identify patients exposed to a higher risk of hemorrhages. Nikolsky et al. have developed a risk score (validated on REPLACE-1 and REPLACE-2 data) based on clinical variable useful to predict the incidence of major peri-procedural bleeding after contemporary PCI using the femoral approach. The clinical variables considered into this algorithm are age \>55 years (integer score 4 for every 10 years over 55), female gender (integer score 3), eGFR \<60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (integer score 2), pre-existing anaemia (integer score 2), and administration of low-molecular weight heparin within 48 hours (integer score 2). Global risk score 0-1 anticipated a major bleeding rate of 1.3%; a risk score 2-6 was associated with a 1.8% risk of major bleeding; a risk score 7-9 associated with a 2.7% risk if major bleeding, whereas a risk score \>=10 was associated with a 5% rate of major bleeding.

Our hypothesis is that bivalirudin, compared with UFH, may provide significant benefits in term of bleeding in the selected population of patients deemed at high risk of bleeding. Our aim is thus to prove, in a double-centres, randomized, blind controlled trial enrolling patients undergoing PCI via the femoral approach, the efficacy in term of haemorrhagic events and, secondarily, the effectiveness and safety of bivalirudin by means of the study drug vs UFH.

Sample size estimation: in this high risk population we expect a rate of major and minor bleeding of \>5% for the UFH group vs a 3% event rate in the bivalirudin group. Aiming for a 0.05 alpha and 0.80 power, a total of 662 patients will need to be enrolled (331 patients per group). This will be increased by about 25% (leading to a total of 830 patients) because of considerable uncertainty about expected end-point rates.",Clinica Mediterranea,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,837.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,PREVENTION,,,DOUBLE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

065e7f3f3f5d3686,NCT03021603,Evaluation on the Effects of a Brief Hope Intervention to the Symptoms in the Palliative Care Patients,A Brief Hope Intervention to Increase the Hope Level and to Improve the Physical and Mental Health of Patients Receiving Palliative Care: a Randomized Controlled Trial,,HSEARS20160205005,"Aims. This paper describes the study protocol of a manualized brief positive intervention (BHI). In addition, it reports the on the modification of a hope intervention based on the theoretical proposition - hope theory, and its feasibility when applying to palliative cancer and non-cancer patients.

Background. Hope was found to account for therapeutic changes in clients with depressive symptoms or chronic pain. Nevertheless, little is known about the integration of such active ingredients to brief and low intensity psycho-therapeutic interventions to patients receiving palliative care were not adequately tested.

Design. The study included two stages: (1) manual development, and (2) a single blinded randomized controlled trial.

Methods. Participants will be randomly assigned in equal number into either the brief hope intervention or the controlled arm on completion of the baseline assessment. Participants of the intervention group will be receiving the four-week intervention, while those allocated to the control arm will be receiving the routine care and social chats. The intervention is a manualized program that consists of four sessions at weekly intervals (two face to face sessions and two telephone follow up in between). The core content is modified from an eight sessions hope therapy. Expert panel feedback and trial on targeted populations were completed. Four participants received the program to determine its acceptability prior to feasibility testing. The process and practical considerations were evaluated to allow refinement of the program and to ensure the quality of intervention.

Outcome measures comprise of changes in state hope score and the depression scores measured respectively by State Hope Scale and Centre for Epidemiological Study Depression Scale. The secondary outcomes are the common signs and symptoms in cancer patients measured by The Condensed Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale. Data collection will be done prior to the intervention (baseline), immediately and one month after the intervention. Additional use of qualitative interview to explore their experiences in the intervention, including satisfaction with the intervention and the treatment fidelity will be conducted.","Introduction According to the Medical Research Council guidance, there are four critical steps to systematically establish a standardize intervention content and mode of delivery through phased approach. Theory and evidence-based practice, feasibility or piloting to test the procedure, estimate recruitment/retention, determining sample size, evaluation and implementation are the four keys of the best practice described in the guideline. In this article, we reported three steps in developing an evidence-based intervention, namely brief hope intervention that addresses the management of cancer and palliative care patients: (1) preparation of the present program, (2) description of the protocol of the feasibility test, and (3) an experimental study using wait list control design.

Background Hope intervention is grounded on positive psychology and is mapped onto cognitive-behavioral therapy. It aligns with the 2014-2018 Oncology Nursing Society research priorities, which indicated the need for evaluating the efficacy of integrating protective factors, such as hope, to the care delivery to the patient and family caregivers. In a similar vein, growing evidence has shown the increasing needs of quality palliative care for non-cancer patients, who suffer from complex illnesses and progressing to end-of-life. These patients having unpredictable disease trajectories, significant loss and grief, and anticipated death would lead to depression and hopelessness. As such, the intervention should be extended to non-cancer patients in their last phase of life. The goal of health-promoting palliative care is to create a supportive environment and strengthen actions that intervene along the journey of care giving, loss and death and dying. In a systematic review, hope was found to account for therapeutic changes in clients with depressive symptoms or chronic pain. Nevertheless, such active ingredients of the psychotherapy are not standard elements of multi-modal care management. This warrants the field testing of the present brief hope intervention in patients receiving palliative care.

Hope Theory Hope theory is adopted as the framework in the present study, where hope was believed as the central agent to facilitate the change process. It focuses on three core features: (1) goal setting (goals), (2) problem solving (pathways) and (3) positive self-talk (agency). These elements underlie the key hope strategies used in the intervention. By increasing hope level, the likelihood of therapeutic change will be increased. Its current emphasis complemented the traditional cognitive behavioral therapy by shifting the primary focus on positive potentials as the starting point, thereby promoting meaning in life, fostering personal strengths, positive changes and improving well-being.

Some believed that being overly optimistic is harmful. However, nurturing hope was found to be one of the significant elements in staying positive in the coping experiences of Chinese couples living with cancer. Evidence has shown that high-hope individuals were found to be more creative and effective problem solvers. More important, a number of studies have reported the positive effect of hope in newly diagnosed cancer patient, for example, health, quality of life, self-esteem, reduced major cancer symptoms, such as pain, fatigue, cough, and depression in lung cancer patients or promoting positive changes in breast cancer patients. However, many of these researches are cross-sectional surveys or qualitative studies; others are mindfulness-based or spiritual-based interventions where hope is only one of the active components in the program. Whether improving the hopeful state of cancer patients and palliative care patients would lead to better clinical outcomes remains under explored.

Brief Hope Intervention The present study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a brief hope intervention in improving the hope level and the physical and mental health of cancer and non-cancer Hong Kong Chinese patients who are receiving palliative care. This low intensity psychological intervention can be delivered by caregiver such as nurses to address the needs of these patients and to build their mental and/or physical abilities. Additionally, the skills could be streamlined in daily nursing practice and an ongoing self-help strategy. Would brief hope intervention be as effective as the standard session in clinical population?

Optimal Length of Hope Intervention Preliminary evidence was found. Literature showed that the role and value of hope at the early counseling sessions enhanced a literal shift to experience a sense of worthiness. Focused hope intervention (90 minutes) has led to higher level of hope and increase in perceived life meaning. The statistical robustness is supported by the comparable effect sizes achieved by both the eight 2-hours sessions and the 90-minute single session in previous studies on hope therapy. The effect sizes on the agency and pathway hope scale scores were 0.65 and 0.38 respectively in the long intervention, and were 0.43 and 0.38 in the brief interventions. One large scale brief positive psychology intervention with hope-based intervention (single session plus one booster session) recruited 1,734 participants from the community, showed positive significant changes in well-being and family happiness (ES 0.11-0.14) (Zhou et al., 2015). Encouraging results were also demonstrated is other studies, which has tested a brief meaning in life intervention for advanced cancer Chinese patients (2-sessions: 30-60 and 15-30 minutes respectively). It showed improvement in quality of life and existential distress. Wong, Wong, \& Chang (2015) also found a four-sessions program (one visit plus three telephone follow up) effective in reducing hospital readmission in community dwelling patients with chronic illnesses. Nevertheless, there is insufficient evidence on the optimal length of hope intervention for cancer and palliative patients that would produce the desired effect. Thus the present study results could underpin effective palliative care provision across a range of services from hospitalization to discharge facilitation.

Aims The primary research question is whether brief hope intervention would improve the hopeful state and reduce physical symptoms and/or depression level of patients receiving palliative care. Fidelity was assured at the design level and in intervention delivery to establish a standardized procedure, skill adequacy and translating the intervention from research into clinical practice.

Intervention Description of the intervention The present Brief Hope Intervention is a four-weeks individual intervention, helping participants to develop positive thoughts through skills in goal setting, problem solving and positive self-talk. The program consists of four sessions in total: two face-to-face sessions (1-hour) and two telephone follow up sessions (30 minutes) in between. This serves to create the momentum and continuity of intervention. The first session is the core intervention and the final face-to-face session is a summary talk. Two telephone follow up will review their progress and encourage the practice of hope exercises. Hope enhancement strategies included sharing and recalling past successes, hope-based goal mapping exercises, examining possible pathways to reach the targeted goals, hope visualization exercise and positive self-talk. A booklet will be prepared for the participants for reviewing their planned goals and recording achieved targets. Successful experiences and solutions to perceived barriers are entered. Such take-home exercise helps to extend the participants' practice of hope-based skills into their daily living.

Design and Randomization This study is a randomized controlled trial. On completion of the baseline assessment and the screening procedure, eligible participants will be randomly assigned in equal number into either a brief hope intervention or the control group using sets of computer-generated random numbers. The research assistant conducting the assessments will be blinded to the treatment type. However, participants are inevitably aware of the conditions they have been randomized to. To reduce expectancy effects of the advantages of the program, the control arm is casted as a social intervention. Figure 1 presented the data collection using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials, which will be done before the commencement of the intervention (Time1), immediately post-intervention (Time2) and one month after the completion of program (Time 3).

Regular treatment with long-acting bronchodilators promotes a more sustained reduction of hyperinflation and consequent symptom relief and increase in the patient's ability to overcome physical demands of daily life. Tiotropium bromide (TIO) is a new generation, long-acting anticholinergic bronchodilator that significantly improves lung function, reduces symptoms and improves exercise tolerance in patients with advanced COPD. Indacaterol is a new ultra-long duration (\>24 h) β2-agonist, which promotes sustained dilation of the bronchi with a once-daily administration. Compared to tiotropium, indacaterol provides evidence that is as effective as tiotropium for bronchodilation, as well as other clinical outcomes such as dyspnea and state of health. However, comparative effects of indacaterol versus tiotropium with regard to outcomes in tolerance, dyspnea and dynamic lung hyperinflation during exercise is scarce.

2. Second objective is to examine if the brain magnetic responses associated with the recognition of emotional faces are modified in the paralyzed patients. The investigators will study the brain responses to angry, sad, happy, and neutral faces in a simple emotion recognition task.

Twenty patients with facial palsy will be included in the study. They will undergo two visits, during which MEG will be recorded in two types of tasks: motor task and emotion recognition task (see below). One visit will take place before surgery. The second visit will take place after the surgical intervention and the face motor rehabilitation, 3 to 18 months after the 1st visit.

MOTOR TASK: The motor task will comprise 5 types of simple movements: eye blinks, smiling, tongue protraction, teeth greeting, index flexion. These movements will be performed repetitively - at a pace of about 1 movement every 2 second - in separate, randomly alternating, blocks of 24 movements of each type, for a total of 120 movements of each type.

EMOTION RECOGNITION TASK: A total of 320 faces will be presented to the patients. The faces will be distributed in 5 blocks of 16 different faces (8 male, 8 female), displaying each of 4 emotional expressions: happiness, anger, sadness, and neutral expression. Occasional suprised target faces will be added. The patient's task will be to report the occurrence of those faces by pressing a button in his/her dominant hand. The stimuli will be presented in random order in each block.

The investogators will analyze neuromagnetic activities at the sensor and source levels during the motor tasks (primary objective) and in response to the faces (secondary objective).","Institut National de la Santé Et de la Recherche Médicale, France",OTHER_GOV,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,29.0,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,,BASIC_SCIENCE,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

2. Purpose To investigate effects of different height of abdominal cushion on prone PCNL, in terms of intraoperative parameters. Our study could provide high quality of evidences on making criteria of perioperative nurse.
3. Design 3.1 Participant： A single randomized controlled study 3.2 Number of cases： 180 patients who are candidates for PCNL will be enrolled in this study. By 1:2 simple random sampling technique, patients will be assigned to 60-patient no cushion PCNL and 120-patient cushion PCNL (60-patient for 5 cm cushion and 60-patient for 10 cm cushion).

   * Congenital abnormalities. 4.3 Excluded from the study after inclusion Patients will be excluded from the study if the undergoing standard PNL/mini-perc have purulent fluid in the initial puncture.

   Patients with positive preoperative urine culture should be treated with suitable antibiotics based on the culture sensitivity result for at least 72 h before PCNL. Patients who have negative urine culture should receive a single dose of broad spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis just prior to the procedure. Patients who are going to receive PCNL would get a envelope including a randomized number and consent letter.
5. Surgical technique

   Under general anaesthesia, each patient is initially placed in the lithotomy position, and a 5 Fr or 6Fr ureteral catheter is inserted to the kidney and fixed with a 16 Fr Foley catheter. Then the patient is turned to the prone position. An abdominal cushion is used according to the randomized number. The choice of using C-arm fluoroscopic or ultrasonography guidance or a combination fashion for the percutaneous access was made at the discretion of the treating urologist. The length of the needle from skin to the collecting system is measured to ensure that the length of dilator is appropriate. No patient underwent bilateral simultaneous PCNL and patients with bilateral stones underwent surgery 4 weeks apart. The access tract is dilated with a fascial dilator from 8F up to 18F. The investigators defined access to the collecting system as gaining entry to the targeted urinary system and desired calix. For some complex cases, when indicated requiring multiple tracts, additional tracts were created in the same session. The stone was fragmented by pneumatic lithotripsy or Holmium:YAG laser lithotripsy through 8/9.8F semirigid ureteroscope (Richard Wolf, Germany). The large fragments were extracted with a forceps and small fragments were flushed out with an endoscopic pulsed perfusion pump. A silastic nephrostomy tube was placed at the end of procedure and a 4-6Fr double pigtail ureteral stent was left for 2 weeks after operation. X-ray check for residual stone fragments is also performed at the end of the procedure.

   Patients were candidates for the tubeless procedure only when the following strict conditions were met: single percutaneous tract, absence of major perforation of collecting system and bleeding, complete stone clearance assessed by intraoperative nephroscopy and fluoroscopy at the end of the procedure. For a tubeless procedure, the flank was compressed for 5 min. Patient was monitored for postoperative complications.

Indication for PN and daily prescription will follow the protocol in use in the NICU on behalf of the investigators","Background information

The multichamber bag parenteral solution specially designed for preterm infant has been developed to provide adequate and appropriate mixture of macronutrients (amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids) and micronutrients (electrolytes, vitamins, trace-elements) through either peripheral or central veins in the range of the more recent nutritional recommendations for ELBW, VLBW and LBW infants requiring total or partial parenteral nutrition (Tsang \& al 2005, Espghan-ESPEN Commentary 2005). The multichamber bag parenteral solution for preterm infants NumetaG13% has been evaluated in a phase III study entitled: ""Safety use of a triple chamber bag formula, administered IV during 5 to 10 consecutive days, in preterm infants requiring parenteral nutrition."" EudraCT Number: 2007-001378-97; PPM Number: 36830247 It was a prospective, multicentre, non-comparative phase III study limited to 5 to 10 days of parenteral nutrition. Preterm infants can be include without any restriction of postnatal age and according to the need of informed parental consent, only 30 % of the patient was included during the first 3 days of life. Weight gain and nutritional intakes from the multichamber bag parenteral solution, from additional parenteral and oral supplies were collected daily during the study. Biochemical parameters recorded during the study were limited to BUN, glycemia, triglyceridemia, natremia, kaliemia, calcemia, phosphatemia and plasma bicarbonate concentration collected at inclusion, and at 5 \& 10 days of parenteral nutrition. Performance safety was assessed through the collection of vital signs and adverse events whereas, information on handling and administration of the Ped3CB was evaluated using a visual scale parameters.

Results of the study were summarized in a manuscript recently published in JPGN 2012 referred as. J. Rigo, ML. Marlowe, D. Bonnot, Th. Senterre, A. Lapillonne, E. Kermorvant-Duchemin, JM. Hascoet, R. Desandes, G. Malfilatre, P. Pladys, A. Beuchee, Virginie Colomb. Benefits of a New Pediatric Triple-Chamber Bag for Parenteral Nutrition in Preterm Infants. JPGN2012;54: 210-217

Numeta 13% has been registered in 18 countries in Europe via a decentralized procedure that ended 15th December 2010. In the NICU of the University of Liege, we decided to use Numeta 13% as our standard of parenteral solution for preterm infants from the first day of life and therefore to perform a quality control evaluation of this balanced parenteral solution from the first day of life in preterm infants with a birth weight \<1500 g. collecting nutritional intakes from the bags, additional intakes as well as blood and urine biochemical markers currently evaluated in the NICU.

In this context, we recently reported that using a ready to use binary parenteral solution compounded in the pharmacy hospital it is possible to provide nutritional intakes in the range of the recommendations (Tsang 2005, ESPGHAN-ESPEN 2005), to abolish the cumulative nutritional deficit frequently observed in those preterm infants and to limit the postnatal growth restriction a preterm infants with a birth weight \< 1250 g. (Senterre Th and Rigo J JPGN 2011, Acta Paediatrica 2012). In that study, we suggested that the use from birth of a RTU parenteral solution containing electrolytes, minerals and a high protein (AA):energy ratio improves clinical tolerance and reduces metabolic disturbances during the first week of life in this group of preterm infants (Senterre Th and Rigo J Manuscript in preparation)

Objective of the study

The aim of the present study is to provide further informations to our medical staff and to the the medical community on the adequacy of use and flexibility of Numeta 13%. to provide recommended nutritional intakes and to evaluate the daily biochemical tolerance, and safety issues when administered from the first day of life in a significant population of very low birth weight infants (VLBWI). The secondary objective will be to compare the clinical tolerance and the biochemical laboratory data obtained with Numeta 13% with those recently published in a similar population using a compounded solution prepared in our hospital pharmacy.

Study Design

The study will be carried out as a prospective, monocentric, open label phase IV study in therapeutic use.The hospital pharmacists will dispense to the clinical department the Paediatric 3CB for patient use.

The recruitment will be performed on the base of the consecutive admission rate. Nevertheless, the recruitment will be balanced according to birth weight (\<1000 g, 1000-\<1250 g and \>1250 g) to ensure patient distribution in the ranges of ELBW and VLBW infants.

In patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria, intravenous nutrition will be administered using Numeta 13% up to the end of parenteral support need. Prescription of Numeta 13% will follow the guideline for parenteral nutrition defined at the NICU of the University of Liege Belgium. Activation or non-activation of the lipid bag will be on the discretion of the neonatologist in charge of the preterm infants.

Nutritional intakes (parenteral and oral), body weight, biochemical laboratory data, insulin needs, clinical data and additional treatments will be recorded every day, up to the last infusion day. Prescription of blood and urinary biochemical survey will be performed by the neonatologist in charge of the preterm infants and recorded. When several data of an identical parameter were requested during the same day, the maximal and the minimal data will be recorded and the mean value calculated.

Safety evaluations will be conducted from birth and include daily monitoring of biochemical laboratory data (plasma ionogram, minerals, pH, glucose, BUN and triglycerides) according to biological prescription as well as the daily collection of supplementation needs, vital signs and adverse events.

Treatment

Parenteral support: Numeta 13% administration will be adapted to body weight, post¬natal age, and oral/enteral tolerance and intakes, according to current nutritional guidelines (ESPEN-ESPGHAN 2005, Tsang 2005). The protocol in use in the NICU of the University of Liege will be used and is gathered in table I and II according to the activation or not of the lipid bag Numeta 13% will be administered daily mainly through a central venous catheter.

a168b2c6dbe711af,NCT04491227,Global Assessment of Acute and Chronic Kidney Disease Incidence and Outcomes in Patients With COVID-19 Infection,Global Assessment of Acute and Chronic Kidney Disease Incidence and Outcomes in Patients With COVID-19 Infection,,000295,"The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created a significant strain on health care resources across the world for managing critically ill patients. Emerging reports from China, South Korea and Italy have reported varying incidence of acute kidney (AKI) ranging from 5-15% with a mortality of 60-80% however there is no systematic assessment of the risk factors, recognition, course and outcomes in patients with and without kidney disease whose course is complicated by AKI1-4. Patients with underlying CKD, immunosuppressed patients with renal transplants and ESKD patients are at high risk for COVID-19 infection and there is limited information on the effect of COVID-19 on the course and outcomes of these patients. The requirement for renal support including IHD, CRRT and sorbent based therapies has been variable and has contributed to the intense pressure on the nephrology and critical care providers for delivering these therapies. As the COVID-19 pandemic expands in the USA and abroad, there is an intense need to understand the epidemiology of the disease and the resources needed for renal support to inform clinical management and public health interventions.

In this study, the investigators aim to investigate health care facilities across the world (hospital wards, ICU, outpatient clinics, nursing homes, healthcare centers) to draw a global picture of incidence, risk factors, resources available for treatment and prognosis of acute and chronic kidney disease in patient with COVID 19 confirmed infection. The aim is to identify trends in patients with acute and chronic kidney disease, determine its incidence, treatment and outcomes in different settings across the world. This information will be used to develop and implement educational tools and resources to prevent deaths from AKI and progression of CKD in this and following pandemics.","Acute and Chronic kidney diseases are important causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. The associated socioeconomic burden of kidney disease and AKI, as in some cases recovery is incomplete and chronic kidney disease (CKD) can arise, is a growing problem around the world. During the COVID 19 pandemic the incidence of AKI has been reported to be as low as 0.5% to as high as 23%. AKI was reported to develop at a median of 15 days in one study, and another study reported that most AKI developed within 7 days of admission. The data on acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19 is mostly from patients who are hospitalized, and in some studies limited to critically ill patients in the ICU. In ICU patients the requirement for renal support and mortality is reported to be high, however is a lack of epidemiological studies specifically designed to determine the impact of COVID 19 on kidney outcomes.

The mortality rate of patients with kidney dysfunction varies widely and is inversely related to country income and percentage of gross domestic product spent on total health expenditure. Several initiatives will be very insightful and identified important gaps in knowledge, more effort is required to understand this problem affecting all regions of the globe. In order to eventually implement resources and tools to help prevent, diagnose and treat patients with COVID 19 infection and kidney dysfunction, the investigators need to understand its incidence, risk factors, available resources and barriers to diagnosis and treatment.

This project will collect data on kidney function progression in patients infected with COVID 19 across the world. The study will open to individual physicians across the world who agreed to participate by providing de-identified clinical and lab data of patients with confirmed COVID 19 infection with acute and chronic kidney dysfunction.

Primary Objectives:

1\. Establish incidence and outcomes of acute kidney injury (AKI) in different settings worldwide during the COVID 19 pandemic.

Secondary Objectives:

1. Compare risk factors, etiologies, diagnosis, management and outcomes of acute and chronic kidney dysfunction in COVID 19 patients in different countries
2. Determine resources available for recognition, non-dialytic and dialytic management and follow up of patients with acute and chronic kidney dysfunction and COVID 19 infection in different settings and countries.
3. Determine long term outcomes, 6 months and 1 year, of patients with acute and chronic kidney dysfunction and COVID 19 infection in different settings.
4. Evaluate barriers preventing access to the standard treatments of acute and chronic kidney dysfunction and COVID 19 infection across different countries.

dcc2ab9c9af23710,NCT07169227,"Lidocaine, Paracetamol, and Dexmedetomidine for Rocuronium Injection Pain","The Comparison of the Efficacy of Lidocaine, Paracetamol, and Dexmedetomidine in Preventing Rocuronium Injection Pain",,KA25/209,"Propofol and rocuronium may cause pain during intravenous injection. Various pharmacological agents are used to reduce the incidence and severity of injection pain. Among the most commonly used agents for this purpose are lidocaine, various opioids, ketamine, paracetamol, and dexmedetomidine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the comparative effect of intravenous dexmedetomidine and paracetamol versus lidocaine in preventing propofol- and rocuronium-induced pain during anesthesia induction.","General anesthesia induction is initiated with propofol, and after loss of consciousness is achieved, rocuronium is administered to provide muscle relaxation. Propofol and rocuronium may cause pain during intravenous injection, with an incidence ranging from 20% to 100% for propofol and from 22% to 84% for rocuronium. The current hypothesis regarding the mechanism of pain associated with intravenous drug injection is that stimulation of polymodal nociceptors triggers the release of endogenous pain mediators such as prostaglandins. This stimulation is thought to be related to the non-physiological osmolarity or pH of the drug solution.

The pain that occurs during anesthesia induction may lead to undesirable reflex movements, which can result in accidental dislodgement of the intravenous catheter. In addition, in response to strong nociceptive stimulation, it may also contribute to the development of increased arterial blood pressure and tachycardia. Various pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies have been investigated to reduce the incidence and severity of injection pain. Among the most commonly used agents for this purpose are lidocaine, various opioids, magnesium, sodium bicarbonate, ketamine, paracetamol, and dexmedetomidine.

Although lidocaine is frequently used to prevent propofol/rocuronium injection pain during anesthesia, propofol or rocuronium pain can still occur in up to 30% of cases, even with lidocaine administration. Therefore, there is currently no pharmacological agent in the literature that has been definitively confirmed to reduce propofol/rocuronium pain.

Paracetamol is a widely used agent for pain management and as an antipyretic, although its precise molecular mechanism of action is not fully understood. However, the antinociceptive effects of paracetamol are thought to occur through both peripheral and central mechanisms via inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). With its peripheral effects, paracetamol is thought to reduce propofol- and rocuronium-induced injection pain and the associated involuntary withdrawal movements . In addition, paracetamol has been shown to selectively suppress peripheral PGE₂ release and to increase COX-2 gene expression in an acute inflammation model. Another study reported that paracetamol exhibits selectivity in inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins and related factors. Furthermore, although paracetamol does not inhibit COX enzymes at therapeutic concentrations in vitro, it has been reported to inhibit a variant of COX enzymes in vivo.

Dexmedetomidine is an α₂-adrenergic receptor agonist with supraspinal, spinal, and peripheral effects, possessing strong sedative, analgesic, and sympatholytic properties. Alpha-2 receptors are found in blood vessels and inhibit the release of norepinephrine. Although some studies in the literature have reported that dexmedetomidine reduces propofol- and rocuronium-induced pain, there are also studies that do not support this finding. Moreover, the effective optimal dose of this agent has not yet been clearly established.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the comparative effect of intravenous dexmedetomidine and paracetamol versus lidocaine in preventing propofol- and rocuronium-induced pain during anesthesia induction.

The goal of this study is to identify an effective pharmacological agent to reduce propofol and rocuronium injection pain. This study is a prospective, randomised study involving 170 subjects and they will assessed on the incidence and severity of rocuronium and propofol pain during anesthesia induction. Outcomes from this study can be extended to patients who will be receiving general anaesthesia tube to reduce the incidence and severity of propofol and rocuronium injection pain.",Baskent University,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,170.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,PREVENTION,,,QUADRUPLE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Muscle atrophy is associated to impaired performance in motor tasks, such as posture and locomotion, and is therefore a major cause of loss of autonomy. It requires a stay in follow-up and rehabilitation service, and thus lengthens the duration of hospitalisation.

Data underline the importance of afferent input integrity in the maintenance of muscle characteristics and postural control, and suggest that countermeasure programs based on the stimulation of proprioceptive inputs could be efficient to prevent muscle atrophy and falls. In particular, fundamental studies performed in rodents by the investigators laboratory have demonstrated that the adverse structural and functional adaptations which occur during muscle deconditioning can be counteracted through adequate physiological stimuli such as activation of proprioceptors. Based on this scientific expertise, the investigators aim is thus to prevent muscle atrophy and its functional consequences on posture and locomotion, following a surgical intervention in humans .

The investigators will develop a device allowing stimulation of foot and ankle proprioceptors. In order to facilitate the evaluation of its efficiency, the device will be tested on a selected population confined to bed during a post-operative period (knee replacement). It efficiency will be evaluated by means of three parameters: muscle force of ankle plantar flexor, muscle volume of lower limb muscles, functional outcome (gait and balance analysis).

The technique developed in the present project could bring benefits to patients confined to bed, or in elderly. Preventing or retarding development of muscle atrophy will beneficiate to health and quality of life of these patients. In addition, this device might allow to consider therapeutic strategies for prevention of atrophy in neuromuscular pathologies.","The aim of the study is to study the efficacy of a proprioceptive stimulation device on prevention of calf muscle atrophy after a total knee replacement.

The minimum sample size expected to complete the data collection form of the study was calculated with G power analysis at a 95% confidence level before the data collection phase. Accordingly, the sample size required for the study was determined as 25 for each group, with an alpha value of 0.01, an effect size of 1.583, and a theoretical power of 99% \[23\]. In case of sample loss during the study, it was planned to take 20% more samples than the calculated sample and to include 30 people in each group (with and without ShotBlocker).

As data collection tools; Personal and Applied Drug Information Form and Visual Analog Scale will be used. Personal Information Form will consist of 8 questions in total, 7 of which include the patients' introductory characteristics (age, gender, height, weight, fear of injection) and 1 question including the name of the drug. In addition to this form, Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is used to measure the pain perceived by the person. In this scale, the person can indicate his/her own pain by drawing a line, putting a dot or pointing between the part where there is no pain (zero) on one end of the ruler and the part where there is the most severe pain (10 cm) on the other end. The distance from the point where there is no pain to the point marked by the person is measured in centimeters and the value found indicates the person's pain intensity. In the VAS scale, 0-44 mm reflects mild pain, 45-74 mm reflects moderate pain and 75-100 mm reflects severe pain.

The project will be conducted as a two-armed randomized controlled clinical trial of 5-year duration in 7 clinical centers. 140 systemically healthy patients diagnosed with peri-implantitis will randomly assigned to be treated with or without bone replacement graft. Outcome measures include assessments of inflammation, probing depth, recession, radiological parameters and PROMs.","Objective The overall objective of the project is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the use of a bone substitute material in reconstructive surgical therapy of peri-implantitis-associated osseous defects.

Hypothesis: The use of a bone substitute material in reconstructive therapy of peri-implantitis increases the likelihood to achieve treatment success.

Relevance for clinical practice The project will provide significant contribution to the understanding of outcomes using reconstructive procedures in treatment of peri-implantitis.

Study population, design and treatment procedures The project will be conducted as a two-armed randomized controlled clinical trial of 5-year duration in 7 clinical centers. 140 systemically healthy patients with implants ≥1 year in function and diagnosed with advanced peri-implantitis at ≥1 implants will be enrolled.

Inclusion criteria Age ≥ 18 years

≥1 implant (≥1 year of function) presenting with PPD ≥7 mm and BoP/Pus. Confirmed bone loss ≥3 mm at same implant(s)

Exclusion criteria Treated for peri-implantitis during previous 6 months Intake of systemic or local antibiotics during previous 6 months Systemic conditions affecting peri-implant tissues Systemic conditions impeding surgical intervention

Surgical procedures Surgical procedures will be performed one month after a baseline examination and initiation of plaque control. Three days before surgery a 10-day systemic antibiotic regimen will be initiated. Full thickness flaps will be elevated and inflamed tissues will be removed. The implant surfaces will be cleaned with mini-gauze soaked in saline. The osseous defect should be ≤4 mm wide and \>3 mm deep. The defect should in addition to the mesial and distal bone walls preferably exhibit at least a lingual or a buccal bone wall. The randomly assigned treatment strategy, stratified for smoking, will be revealed after debridement. Test procedure: The defect will be filled with Bio-Oss Collagen® and the flaps will be sutured to their previous position. Control procedure: Flaps will be sutured to their previous position. Sutures will be removed 2 weeks after treatment, followed by a 6-week control. Clinical examinations will be performed at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months after therapy. Maintenance therapy will be provided based on individual needs.

Clinical assessments One calibrated examiner in each clinical center will perform the assessments. The following variables will be assessed at four sites around the implant: Plaque, probing pocket depth (PPD), bleeding on probing (BoP), probing attachment level (PAL) and recession (REC).

Treatment success Treatment success will be defined as the absence of BoP/Pus, PPD ≤5 mm and ≤1 mm recession. Peri-implant sites showing BoP and PPD ≥6 mm at re-examination will be scheduled for further treatment. Patient-related outcome variables will be assessed at baseline and follow-up and include esthetic and functional appreciation, pain or discomfort.

Radiographic assessments Intra-oral radiographs will be obtained prior to surgery (baseline) and at 1-, 3- and 5-year re-examinations. Analysis of radiographs will be performed by specialists in oral-maxillofacial radiology. The examiners will be blinded to treatment procedures. The assessment will include defect fill and crestal bone support.

Power calculation A total of 122 patients (61 per group) will provide a power of 80% with alpha set at 0.05 to detect a difference of 1 mm in mean PPD change between groups, given a SD of 1.97 (Carcuac et al., 2016). 140 individuals will be included to compensate for drop-out.

Data analysis Mean changes for the various variables and the proportion of sites fulfilling the criteria for treatment success will be calculated. A multilevel model with the clinical center as the highest level and the implant as the lowest will be built to test the influence of measured factors on the outcomes and to compensate for potential clustering of data. Data analysis including multilevel modeling will be conducted in collaboration with a biostatistician.

This questionnaire is a tool provided by the French Society for Palliative Cares, aiming at helping the providers of care to identify patients who would require palliative cares.

According to the notice of the questionnaire, patients with a score greater than 3 would be taken in charge by a palliative care team. Considerong the 10 itmes of this questionnaire, it seems that a large majority of patients would have a score greater than 3 in the context of anti cancer centers.

To date, palliative teams are not designed to take in charge such an amount of patients.","Continuous improvement of therapeutics helped to lengthen different stages of natural cancer evolution. Advanced cancer patients are followed-up even longer; therefore there is a need to increase palliative care resources. A global therapeutic approach is being set up gradually thanks to specialized supportive care team. This global approach includes therapeutics and life condition improvement of the patient and his family.

In France, only 2 anti-cancer centers have a palliative care unit. The 16 other centers design hospital beds for palliative care and work with mobile palliative care teams.

According to latest studies with high level of evidence, International oncology societies published good practices guidelines supporting the need of early palliative cares for patients with metastatic cancer.

In 2010, Temel et al. demonstrated early palliative care effectiveness. Indeed, early palliative care led to significant improvements in both quality of life (score on the FACT-L scale: 98.0 vs. 91.5; p=0.03) and mood (depressive symptoms: 16% vs. 38%, P=0.01). Moreover median survival was longer among patients receiving early palliative care (11.6 months vs. 8.9 months, p=0.02). Analysis showed that patients assigned to early palliative care stopped chemotherapy earlier, had a higher enrollment rate in palliative care units and less depressive symptoms when cares were provided by both oncologists and palliative care teams.

Other specific scales support efficiency of early palliative care on quality of life. Early palliative care increases also satisfaction of the cares. Therefore, these results illustrate the need for an early integration of palliative care in France; and this approach is recommended in the third national plan against cancer.

Despite efficacy data, no high international consensus exists on a screening score for patients requiring early palliative care. Some teams therefore use prognostic factors like Barbot score.

Confronted with such difficulties, the French Society for Counselling and Palliative Care create a score (PALLIA-10) with 10 items on personal situation of the patient and his disease. This score helps medical staffs to direct patients to a specialized team as soon as it is \> 3/10.

PALLI-10 score is not optimized because of the large number of patients with a score \> 3 in the French anti-cancer centers. In 2014, a team from Centre Fraçois Baclesse (Caen, France) showed that nearly 65% of hospitalized patients in medicine department has a score PALLIA-10 \> 3/10. Today, mobile palliative care teams are too small to manage so many patients.

First, it is important to evaluate the prevalence of these patients in France.

Potential participants will be given an informed consent and then, they will be included in a screening procedure to assess their eligibility. 86 participants (43 in experimental and 43 in control group-randomly assigned) who pass the screening procedure will be invited to the effectiveness study. The experimental group will receive an 8-session intervention while the control group will receive a brief psychoeducation about problems during COVID-19 pandemic and information about the freely available psychological support options. The measurements will be conducted three times; one week before, one week after and five weeks after the intervention.","The COVID-19 pandemic has an enormous psychological impact worldwide. Individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 have been defined as one of the most vulnerable groups suffering from psychological distress during the pandemic. Individuals who were infected with and recovered from COVID-19 had a significantly increased risk for developing psychiatric conditions such as anxiety and mood disorders, substance use disorders, and insomnia, even when comparing with individuals who had other respiratory tract infections. In addition, these psychiatric conditions remained elevated at the 6-month period for COVID-19 survivors. Therefore, COVID-19 survivors should be considered to be in need of an urgent intervention.

Considering the COVID-19 pandemic and future epidemics of other infectious diseases, more evidence-based psychosocial interventions should be implemented via online services. Group-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is one of the interventions identified as effective in decreasing adverse psychological outcomes of COVID-19 pandemic, as well as of Ebola and Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). One of the forms of CBT is culturally adapted CBT (CA-CBT) developed by Hinton. CA-CBT is a trans-diagnostic method targeting cognitive and behavioral changes while emphasizing emotion regulation and psychological flexibility with some techniques such as mindfulness exercises, meditation, and applied stretching. In Turkey, CA-CBT was tested on adolescents and found to be effective in decreasing the adolescents' anxiety and depression symptoms.

The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial in order to implement culturally adapted cognitive behavioral intervention (CA-CBI) to COVID-19 survivors and evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing the psychological distress for this particular group. After the screening phase and baseline assessment, the investigators will randomly assign the eligible participants into two arms (CA-CBI and Enhanced Treatment as Usual) and deliver CA-CBI in an online group format to the experimental arm. The investigators will assess whether the psychological distress levels and common mental health problems of the COVID-19 survivors in the experimental arm are decreased compared to the control arm. The investigators will examine the study outcomes of the both arms at three times: Pre-assessment (1 week before the intervention), post-assessment (1 week after the intervention) and follow-up assessment (1 month after the post-assessment). A process evaluation according to the World Health Organization (WHO) will be completed with 5 study completers, 5 drop-outs and 2 facilitators to evaluate the feasibility of delivering CA-CBI.

To the knowledge, CA-CBI has not been conducted with survivors of an infectious disease before. Also, there are scarce publications on mental health interventions implemented to COVID-19 survivors. There is a need for more evidence-based psychological interventions that can be applied to the times of COVID-19 pandemic and future epidemics of infectious diseases, especially for vulnerable groups. Therefore, the investigators will contribute to the literature by applying online-delivered group-based CA-CBI to COVID-19 survivors with increased levels of psychological distress.",Koç University,OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,34.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,TREATMENT,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

We propose to carry out a trial to test the effect of DHA compared to a placebo (a pill with no drug in it) on several aspects of autism in children and adolescents, in a 12-week clinical study with children or adolescents in the age group of 5-17 with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. Additionally this trial will study genes related to the therapeutic agent, DHA, and biomarkers related to DHA in the urine.","Growing evidence supports oxidative stress may contribute to autism. Docosa Hexanoic Acid(DHA)is a normal substance that is present in large amounts in the brain and can be used by the body to produce natural antioxidants. Our hope is that supplementing DHA in individuals with autism may improve some aspects of their functioning. Specifically our aims are:

Aim 1. To assess the effect of DHA vs. placebo treatment on the global severity of child and adolescent autistic disorder, via a 12-week double blind placebo-controlled parallel study. Global severity will be assessed by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G) and additionally in younger children by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale.

Aim 2. To assess the effect of DHA vs. placebo treatment on behavioral symptoms and functional ability in children with autism. Assessment will be by the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC)-Community Version11.

Aim 3. To develop an improved protocol and study design based upon these studies for future large scale studies of DHA in the autistic population.

Aim 4. Monitor the effects of therapy on the isoprostane biomarker. Aim 5: Develop additional biomarkers that correlate with autism and with therapy. We will extend the analyses to neuroprostanes and resolvins. We will measure: (i) Urinary excretion of the isoprostane metabolites, 2,3 Dinor-5,6 dihydro-PGF2t and iPF4α-VI. (ii) DHA derived resolvins D2, D4, D5 and D6 and neuroprotectin.

Aim 6: Confirm our preliminary results by correlating increased isoprostane excretion with GSTM1\*0 copy number in individuals with autism.

Aim 7: In the same way, correlate GSTM1\*0 copy number with response to therapy assessed by diminution of isoprostane excretion during therapy.

Aim 8: Study additional biomarkers developed through Hypothesis #2 for correlation with GSTM1\*0 copy number and response to therapy to identify additional gene-biomarker correlations.

Aim 9: Study additional polymorphisms of genes related to DHA metabolism, for association with autism, gene-biomarker correlations, and correlation with response to therapy.","Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey",OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,132.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,TREATMENT,,,QUADRUPLE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

The secondary study aims of this study are to

1\. Compare the differences of RV remodeling in repaired TOF patients, PS patients with sex and age-matched controls 2, Assess the relationship of our proposed parameters to global RV function and exercise capacity in repaired TOF patients and PS patient","Right ventricular (RV) function is increasingly recognized to play an important role in the clinical status and long-term outcome in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) as well as ischemic cardiomyopathy with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. However, quantitation of RV characteristics and function, in particular for regional RV characteristics and function, are still challenging due to its complex morphology and its thin wall with coarse trabeculations. The remarkable improvement in survival of CHD patients has led to a continuously growing number of grown-up CHD. In addition, some defects (e.g., Ebstein's anomaly) may be diagnosed for the first time in adult. Majority of these CHD patients face a lifetime of problems including RV dilation, ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. Therefore, accurate depictions of the RV remodeling process facilitate disease would aid in surveillance and monitoring of therapeutic efficacy.

CHD patients, even after corrective surgery, need lifetime surveillance and yearly clinical evaluation. Currently, clinical evaluation includes ECG and pulse oximetries alongside clinical examination. Investigation of anatomy and physiology of RV are changing from invasive studies (right heart catheterization) to noninvasive imaging techniques including: echocardiography, nuclear scintigraphy, computed tomography, and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. In short, echocardiography is largely operator dependent and suffers from poor inter-study reproducibility. The complex geometry of the RV makes it difficult to accurately quantify its remodeling before and after intervention. Nuclear scintigraphy and computed tomography are constrained by the need for ionizing radiation as well as the poor temporal resolution of the technique. CMR has been considered the golden reference technique for RV volume and ejection fraction.

From current state-of-the-art in CMR, generation of RV volume and ejection fraction, global measures of RV remodeling, requires extensive manual contouring.

Sometimes these can extend to the anal sphincter, and these are referred to as Obstetric Anal Sphincter Injuries (OASIs). Occasionally OASIs may not be detected at delivery. If these tears are missed they would not be repaired and this may lead to incontinence of wind (flatus) or of faeces, both of which can have a significant impact on quality of life. The investigators would like to establish whether a 3D ultrasound scan probe placed outside the vagina can identify the anal sphincter defects and to investigate whether the use of TPUS immediately after primary repair of OASIs is an useful tool to minimise an inadequate repair. The investigators would also like to look at changes that occur to the pelvic floor muscles during labour and to identify injuries to the pelvic floor muscle (levator ani) by ultrasound. Such injury to pelvic floor muscle is associated with vaginal prolapse.","Following the first vaginal delivery 85% of women will sustain perineal trauma (1). Sometimes these can extend to the anal sphincter, and these are referred to as Obstetric Anal Sphincter Injuries (OASIs).

Occasionally OASIs may not be detected at delivery. If these tears are missed they would not be repaired and this may lead to incontinence of wind (flatus) or of faeces, both of which can have a significant impact on quality of life.

Endoanal ultrasound (where an ultrasound probe is inserted directly into the back passage) is the gold standard diagnostic tool to detect OASIs. It is however not available in most obstetric units. Transperineal ultrasound (where an ultrasound probe is placed on the perineum)(TPUS) in contrast is available in most obstetric units and therefore we wish to determine whether TPUS in addition to a routine clinical examination will increase the detection rate of OASIs.

Anal incontinence can also occur if the anal sphincter are not repaired adequately. Therefore we want to investigate whether the use of TPUS immediately after primary repair of OASIs is an useful tool to minimise an inadequate repair.

The other aim of the study is to look at changes that occur to the pelvic floor muscles during labour by ultrasound. It is known that certain muscle changes may lead to urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. However limited studies have evaluated the natural history of the pelvic floor muscles in labour. We therefore wish to perform a transperineal ultrasound each time the midwife or doctor caring for the woman in labour decides the woman in labour needs a vaginal examination. This will provide important information regarding changes that occur to the muscles of the pelvic floor during normal labour.

The incidence of gastrointestinal infections is very high. In European countries 10-25% of the population suffers from at least one foodborne infection per year. Probiotics may strengthen human resistance to gut infections as they may beneficially modulate the intestinal microbiota composition and activity, and the immune function upon intestinal infection.

Aim:

To study whether probiotics improve the resistance of humans to enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC).

Study design:

The PRETEC study is a parallel, double-blind, placebo-controled 4-weeks intervention with probiotics in healthy volunteers. In this study, the effect of probiotic intervention vs placebo on several infection markers in response to an ETEC challenge is investigated. Participants will be randomly assigned to the probiotic or placebo group (n=21 per group). Subjects will be instructed to maintain their habitual food intake, but to standardize their dietary calcium intake. After an adaptation period of 2 weeks, subjects will be orally infected with a live, but attenuated, ETEC vaccine (strain E1392-75-2A; collection NIZO food research; dose will be 10E10 CFU). This ETEC strain induces mild and short-lived infectious diarrhea symptoms. Before and after infection, a diary will be kept to write down all food and drinks consumption (2x2 days) to assess the habitual dietary intake. The diary will also be used for daily recording of bowel habits and frequency and severity of gastrointestinal complaints. Blood is sampled for immune response analyses and multiple faecal samples are collected to quantify several infection- and immune system markers, to determine probiotic excretion, and to verify dietary calcium intake.

Study population:

Healthy males of 20-55 yrs of age.

Interventions:

Probiotics (freeze-dried powder, dose 10E9 CFU twice daily) or placebo (carrier material powder of identical appearance).

Primary outcomes:

Total fecal ETEC excretion per day and severity of diarrhea (quantified by faecal output per day).

Secondary outcomes:

Serum immune response to ETEC, self-reported stool consistency scores and gastrointestinal complaints, relative faecal wet weight, sIgA and calprotectin in faeces, probiotic persistence and levels of opportunistic pathogens in the endogenous microbiota.",The timeframes for analysis of the primary and secondary outcomes is mentioned below in the Outcome Measures section.,NIZO Food Research,OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,40.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,PREVENTION,,,TRIPLE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

In comatose patients resuscitated from out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), neurological injuries remain the leading cause of death. The in-hospital mortality is reported at 30-50%, and the total mortality, although improved substantially over the last decade, remain to be significant, in most countries at up to 90%. The brain of a patient resuscitated after cardiac arrest (CA) may have suffered ischemia and when spontaneous circulation is re-established, the subsequent reperfusion may cause further damage. Brain ischemia and the reperfusion injury lead to tissue degeneration and loss of neurological function, the extent dependent on duration and density of the insult. Temperature control and Targeted Temperature Management (TTM) targeting 33-36°C may mitigate this damage and is recommended in current international guidelines. However, managing post cardiac arrest patients are much more complicated than TTM alone, and blood pressure measurements and mechanical ventilation as part of post resuscitation care is emphasized. An adequate blood pressure must be maintained in the post-cardiac arrest patient. Episodes of hypotension can cause secondary injury, in addition to any initial insult incurred during the arrest by the brain and other organs. Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) should be above 65 mmHg to reverse the acute shock state, and may preferably 80 to 100 mmHg to optimize cerebral perfusion. When determining blood pressure goals, clinicians must balance the metabolic needs of an ischemic brain with the potential for overstressing a decompensated heart. Cerebral autoregulation is often impaired after cardiac arrest, and brain perfusion declines when the MAP falls below 80 to 100 mmHg. Thus, maintaining an adequate MAP helps to avoid further brain injury. However, blood pressure goals have not been investigated in prospective clinical trials, and remain to be based on observational data and extrapolation from experimental data. While experimental studies suggest that high mean blood pressure targets are needed for maintaining cerebral blood flow, registries on consecutive clinical cases undergoing post resuscitation care suggest that lower blood pressure targets are used in clinical practice. But data RCT´s addressing specific targets in post resuscitation care have not been performed. The current trial addresses these strategies for neuroprotection in using design of two different target blood pressure levels. Intervention: 1:1 randomization:

""Normal MAP"" (approximately 65 mmHg) vs. ""high MAP"" (approximately 75 mmHg) Markers measuring global cerebral ischemia caused by cardiac arrest and consecutive resuscitation, and reflecting the metabolic changes after successful resuscitation are urgently needed to enable a more personalized resuscitation and post resuscitation care.

It is technically simple and feasible to place a microdialysis catheter in the jugular bulb and monitor biochemical variables related to cerebral energy metabolism bedside. The LP ratio obtained from microdialysis of cerebral venous blood may be a sensitive indicator of impending cerebral damage and might play a critical role in detecting the early responses of post resuscitation care. Aim of this study is to investigate the global cerebral metabolic changes during CA and post-resuscitation care.

Aim: The study aim to (I) investigate whether the LP ratio obtained by microdialysis (MD) of the cerebral venous outflow reflects a derangement of global cerebral energy state during the peri-cardiac arrest period and (II) investigate the correlation between LP ratio and neurological outcome among patients with cardiac arrest and (III) investigate the correlation between LP ratio and the randomized blood pressure targets.

Design: The trial was a sub-study in the Blood Pressure and Oxygenation Targets after Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest-trial (BOX, clinicaltrials.gov NCT03141099). This single center randomized trial allocated 60 comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients undergoing TTM, to normal or high blood pressure target during ICU stay. Secondary a descriptive prospective cohorte study, measuring LP ratio obtained by microdialysis (MD) of the cerebral venous outflow, during the peri-cardiac arrest period.

Primary outcome: Analysis will compare the two target blood pressure groups with respect to LP ratio.

Secondary outcomes: Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) when discharged from hospital, time to death, daily cumulated vasopressor requirement during ICU stay and need for combination of vasopressors and inotropic agents or mechanical circulatory support. All end-points are correlated to the randomized blood pressure groups. A stratified analysis by the following pre-defined design variables will also be performed: sex, age above median, median time to ROSC, known hypertension, known COPD, shockable primary rhythm.

Method: Interventions are considered emergency procedures and study blood pressure measurement using the study blood pressure modules should be commenced as soon as possible after sustained ROSC, screening and randomisation. Study target blood pressure will be blinded. Patients will be mechanically ventilated, sedated (propofol/fentanyl) and when necessary paralysed with neuromuscular blocking agents to reduce shivering and subsequent heat-generation and energy consumption. The core body temperature will be set as quickly as possible at the predefined target temperature, according to intervention allocation, with 4°C intravenous solutions, and commercially available cooling devices at the discretion of the treating physician. The target core temperature is then maintained for 24 h. After the maintenance period core temperature is gradually raised to normothermia of 37°C with a rewarming rate of no more than 0.5°C/hour. Body temperature is then maintained at normothermia 37 ±0.5°C for as long the as patient is comatose until 72 hours from sustained ROSC in treatment groups, using pharmacological treatment and temperature management systems when applicable.

The study is targeting low-normal paO2 of 9.5 kPa during TTM and when mechanical ventilation is needed. The target PaO2 is reached by adjusting FiO2 and PEEP on the ventilator as long as the patient in on controlled ventilation. Patients ventilation is adjusted, targeting normocapnia of paCO2 of 4,5 - 6,0 in all patients. Serial arterial blood gas analyses will be performed open label using the commercially available equipment adjusted to 37 °C (alpha-stat).

MD catheter (CMA 67, MDialysis AB, Stockholm, Sweden) is placed in a retrograde direction into the jugular bulb. A second identical MD catheter is inserted into one brachial artery. Both catheters are inserted through a peripheral intravenous 17 GA cannula using ultrasound guidance. The positioning of the catheter in the jugular bulb above the inlet of the common facial vein is verified on lateral neck radiograph according to accepted principles. MD catheters are perfused by MD pumps (CMA 106, MDialysis AB, Stockholm, Sweden) at 0.3 μL/min. The perfusates are collected in microvials and analyzed every one hour for 72 hours by enzymatic photometric techniques and displayed bedside (Iscus, Mdialysis AB, Stockholm, Sweden). The analyses include the variables routinely monitored during intracerebral microdialysis: glucose, pyruvate, lactate, glutamate and glycerol.

Neurological status, according to the CPC-scale, and survival are evaluated every day in the intensive care unit and/or at day 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and at hospital (including local hospital) discharge, whichever comes first.

The Danish Regional Committee on Health and Research Ethics approved the study. Trial registration: S-20150173 HLP.

Perspectives The prognosis of patients who are admitted in a comatose state following successful resuscitation after cardiac arrest remains uncertain. Although the introduction of therapeutic hypothermia (TH), targeted temperature management (TTM) and improvements in post-resuscitation care have significantly increased the number of patients who are discharged home with minimal brain damage, short-term assessment of neurological outcome remains a challenge. The need for early and accurate prognostic predictors is crucial, especially since sedation and TH/TTM may alter the neurological examination and delay the recovery of motor response for several days. The development of additional tools, including electrophysiological examinations (electroencephalography and somatosensory evoked potentials), neuroimaging and chemical biomarkers, may help to evaluate the extent of brain injury in these patients. Accurate prognostication of comatose patients treated with TH/TTM can be obtained only 72 to 96 hours after CA and requires a multimodal approach.

Markers measuring cerebral ischemia caused by cardiac arrest and consecutive resuscitation, and reflecting the metabolic changes after successful resuscitation are urgently needed to enable a more personalized resuscitation and post resuscitation care. The LP ratio obtained from microdialysis of cerebral venous blood may play a critical role in detecting the early responses of post resuscitation care, and may predict in hospital and long term prognosis in patients affected by brain injury after CA.

During the peri-cardiac arrest period the LP ratio obtained by microdialysis of the cerebral venous outflow may reflects a derangement of global cerebral energy state. The LP ratio obtained from microdialysis of cerebral venous blood in humans may be a sensitive indicator of impending cerebral damage among patients with cardiac arrest. Further, the study investigates the correlation between LP ratio and the randomized blood pressure targets. In the future this might optimize and individualize the management of post cardiac arrest patients.

Appendix:

Pre-defined methodological substudy conducted prior to the MICA-RCT:

This single-center prospective feasibility study explores the possibilities to use microdialysis (MD) for continuous monitoring of cerebral energy metabolism by analyzing the draining cerebral venous blood. Eighteen comatose patients (same inclusion criteria as MICA-study but without the MAP intervention) )will be continuously monitored with jugular bulb and radial artery (reference) MD following resuscitation. This feasibility study was designed to investigate whether bedside JBM reflects secondary brain injury after OHCA, and may be implemented as a clinical tool with implications for early prognosis and individualized treatment improving patient outcome. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis whether the lactate/pyruvate (LP) ratio monitored in the cerebral venous outflow reflected brain energy metabolism after cardiac arrest and hence was different from the LP ratio monitored in arterial blood.

The primary objective was to compare time-averaged means of microdialysis parameters (intervals of 12 hours) of the jugular venous and the arterial blood during post-resuscitation care. Secondary objectives of clinical interest were to compare (i) neuro-metabolic patterns between patients with unfavorable and favorable neurological outcome (ii) total duration of cerebral desaturation and clinical outcome.

Risks and discomforts: Few. The retrograde MD catheter is inserted under ultrasound guidance and is associated with a small (\<2%) risk of localized bleed which can be managed by manual compression. Accidental arterial puncture occurs and is managed by manual compression. Strokes and air emboli are extremely rare and symptoms are usually transient. The blood drawn for blood gas analyses is not associated with increased risk, the volume needed is approximately 50 ml total and thus not associated with increased risks.",Odense University Hospital,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,60.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,"Single center randomized trial with allocation of 60 comatose out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients undergoing TTM, to normal or high blood pressure target during ICU stay.

73853175406939e4,NCT06158542,AI Prediction of Post-Induction Hypotension in Cesarean Sections With Spinal Anesthesia,Development of an Artificial Intelligence Algorithm to Predict Hypotension Risk After Induction in Cesarean Sections With Spinal Anesthesia,,GO 22/1285,"The cesarean section, medically necessary for both the mother and the baby in certain cases, is a life-saving operation.The most commonly used anesthesia method worldwide is spinal anesthesia. While spinal anesthesia has many advantages, it also has disadvantages. One of the most commonly encountered disadvantages is the development of hypotension due to the unopposed parasympathetic response after induction. Determining which patient will develop hypotension and which patient will not remains an important question for anesthesiologists before surgery. Identifying high-risk patients for hypotension before starting spinal anesthesia and even knowing the percentage of patients who will develop hypotension undoubtedly saves time in problem-solving. From this perspective, the idea for this study emerged: identifying parameters with the potential for use in prediction based on the literature, collecting data, then testing the relationship between them using machine learning methods, and developing an algorithm capable of predictive analysis.

At the end of the study, an artificial intelligence algorithm for predicting hypotension after induction will be developed, and its performance will be tested.

The main goals of the study:

i)Create a dataset including the clinical characteristics, demographic data, and blood test results of patients who develop and do not develop hypotension after spinal anesthesia.

ii) Develop an artificial intelligence algorithm using the dataset and determine the most accurate algorithm for predicting hypotension.

iii) To test the accuracy of the developed algorithm, create a test dataset, measure and optimize the algorithm's performance. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves will be used for performance measurement.

iv) Create a suitable interface (a surface for interaction with the software) to make the developed algorithm usable in clinical practice.","Rationale: Cesarean section, when indicated correctly, is a childbirth method that preserves the health of both the mother and the baby. The rates of births by cesarean section have been increasing worldwide for years. Between 2010 and 2018, 21.1% of globally tracked births were performed by cesarean section. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it is expected that this rate will increase, reaching 29% by the year 2030.

The anesthesia for cesarean section is fundamentally influenced by both the physiological and pathological changes induced by pregnancy in the mother's body. Changes occurring during pregnancy and childbirth, and the resulting differences, can present challenges for anesthesiologists.

Spinal anesthesia induces iatrogenic sympathetic blockade, reducing systemic vascular resistance along with arterial and venous vasodilation, leading to hypotension. The incidence of hypotension after spinal anesthesia in pregnant women ranges from 7.4% to 74%. The frequency of hypotension is higher in pregnant women due to factors such as supine hypotension syndrome caused by fetal inferior vena cava compression and the development of collateral venous plexus in the epidural area, leading to the ascent of intrathecal local anesthetic in the cerebrospinal fluid. The deepening of hypotension and bradycardia in the patient can result in cardiac collapse, fetal hypoxia, and acidosis, posing an unpredictable risk to both maternal and fetal health. The role of anesthesiologists is to prevent or manage this risky condition effectively.

Recent advances in deep learning and artificial intelligence (AI) have found their place in the field of anesthesia. AI applications in anesthesia can be categorized into five main areas: 1) Monitoring the depth of anesthesia (e.g., techniques analyzing EEG data during anesthesia), 2) Control of anesthetic drug delivery based on depth of anesthesia, 3) Event prediction, 4) Ultrasound guidance, and 5) Pain management.

Among these applications, event prediction is particularly critical for anesthesiologists. Knowing about an event before it occurs contributes to its prevention or enables more accurate management. There have been 53 studies in the literature using AI for event prediction, including studies developing algorithms to predict hypotension during surgery and validating these algorithms. What sets this project apart from existing studies are:

These studies have not been specifically developed to predict spinal anesthesia-induced hypotension during cesarean sections.

These studies have mostly used wave analysis (non-invasive or invasive) for predicting hypotension. In this project, this approach will not be utilized. Preoperative assessments will be conducted, and patient characteristics will be recorded. Therefore, the resulting algorithm will not be a dynamic/real-time data input algorithm.

AI and its subset, machine learning algorithms, impact every aspect of our lives. In the medical field, it has become a method, especially in reducing human error in clinical decision-making.

In this study, demographic information, vital signs, specific blood parameters, and certain characteristics related to the administration of spinal anesthesia will be systematically recorded for pregnant women undergoing spinal anesthesia. Blood parameters include complete blood count, serum electrolytes, liver enzyme levels (ALT/AST), and Syndecan-1. All blood parameters are listed in the original study protocol. Syndecan-1 is a molecule shed into the serum with the degradation or damage of the vascular endothelial glycocalyx layer. Particularly, it rises during volume loading, sepsis, or inflammatory processes. Serum Syndecan-1 levels increase as the weeks of pregnancy progress, with the most significant increase occurring between the 20th and 30th weeks. If preeclampsia develops in the later stages of pregnancy, Syndecan-1 levels decrease.

In a study examining the preoperative and postoperative levels of Syndecan-1 in cesarean section patients who underwent spinal anesthesia, a significant difference was found. The study concluded that preoperative prophylactic fluid bolus administration affected endothelial glycocalyx degradation. Based on this study, Syndecan-1 has the theoretical potential to be a new marker for predicting hypotension. Although Syndecan-1 has been studied in pregnant women before, there is no study in the literature examining the relationship between preoperative Syndecan-1 levels and hypotension during spinal anesthesia in cesarean section patients. This study will both investigate the relationship between Syndecan-1 and hypotension and evaluate its place in the developed algorithm.

After recording the initial data for each patient, the development of hypotension will be observed and documented. The collected data will be analyzed to examine the relationships between the occurrence or non-occurrence of hypotension after induction. Additionally, an artificial intelligence algorithm will be developed using this data. The primary aim is to develop the algorithm. During the study, there will be no changes in the anesthesia management applied to the pregnant women.

In this context, the developed algorithm aims to early identify hypotension caused by spinal anesthesia (predicting the risk of hypotension before the operation starts) and enable early initiation of treatment.

Method:

Time of the Project: The ethical approval for the project has been granted by the Hacettepe University Non-Interventional Clinical Research Ethics Board. The project is planned to be conducted between November 2023 and April 2024.

Methodology and Data Collection Tools of the Project:

Data of patients meeting the inclusion criteria in the Operating Room will be obtained from routine test results sent after hospitalization for cesarean section, preoperative nurse observation forms, and records of vital signs monitored by anesthesia during surgery. After the patient is taken to the operating room, the information in the Data Collection Form will be filled out by the anesthesiologist. The duration of hypotension after spinal anesthesia begins immediately after anesthesia administration in pregnant women, reaching its lowest level within approximately 10-15 minutes. It is known to return to normal within 20-30 minutes. However, the duration of hypotension can vary depending on factors such as gestational age, anesthesia dose, overall health status of the patient, and other factors. Especially in pregnant women with high anesthesia doses or hypertension, the duration of hypotension can be longer . Therefore, the duration of hypotension needs to be evaluated individually for each patient. However, in this study, observation for the first 15 minutes is preferred. This preference is made because the algorithm predicts spinal-induced hypotension based on preoperative characteristics. With the extended observation period, the occurrence of childbirth, the increase in cardiac output, and the initiation of oxytocin infusion during the operation make hemodynamics a complex situation affected by multiple independent factors. Data collection will end after the first 15 minutes, and hypotension occurring after the 15th minute will not be recorded for the study; the observation will be terminated.

Collection of Project Data:

Before patients are taken to the operating room, an adequate amount of blood will be drawn from the routine pre-delivery blood samples taken from the patient for the blood parameters . Except for Syndecan-1, the other parameters in the blood parameters are routine tests routinely performed in the Hacettepe University Hospital Biochemistry laboratories.

When measuring syndecan-1, absorbance readings will be conducted using the SpectraMax-M2 (Molecular Devices, USA) device located in the Department of Biochemistry at Hacettepe University. Subsequently, serum syndecan-1 levels will be calculated using the GraphPad Prism program based on the standard graph. The procurement of the necessary ELISA kits for syndecan-1 measurement will be carried out through funding obtained from Hacettepe University's Scientific Research and Project Office.

Data Analysis:

Throughout the steps of algorithm development, the Python programming language will be used. The development process of the artificial intelligence algorithm will follow the Guidelines for Developing and Reporting Machine Learning Predictive Models in Biomedical Research: A Multidisciplinary View guideline. The steps are as follows:

* Data Collection: Data will be recorded by filling out the Data Collection Form.
* Data Processing: After data collection, the data will be processed, and it will be randomly split into training data and internal validation data. The data will be cleaned of artifacts and misreadings.
* Annotation: Data will be labeled for the classification of artificial intelligence, and the definition of hypotension will be annotated. Studies will be conducted to determine the potential of detecting hypotension with artificial intelligence.
* Feature Selection: Features that predict annotated events to the highest extent will be chosen. One or more feature selection algorithms will be used for this process, and features will be selected based on the success achieved in the models.
* Model Creation: The most relevant features in the data will be selected, and a model will be developed. Fundamental classification algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, Random Forest, commonly used for classification processes in the literature, will be employed to obtain basic performance ratios. Subsequently, a deep learning method will be developed, and the performance difference between the proposed method and the basic methods will be examined

Cross-Validation: The performance of the initial version of the model will be repeatedly subjected to cross-validation with subgroups of data that the model has never seen before. This will determine the model's performance by examining performance changes as the data varies. Depending on the data size, either 10-fold Cross-Validation or 5-fold Cross-Validation methods will be employed.

Internal Validation: The predictive performance of the algorithm trained with the training data will be assessed using internal validation data that it has never encountered.

In addition to the algorithm development process, if the variables being compared are normally distributed, statistical tests such as ANOVA; Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U test will be used based on the number of compared groups and the normal distribution analysis of variables. Pearson Correlation Analysis and Spearman Correlation Analysis will be used to analyze the relationship between hypotension values and other continuous parameters based on the normal distribution analysis of variables. Moreover, the predictability of the system will be tested using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), odds ratio (OR), risk ratio (RR), receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve (AUROC), and Pearson correlation coefficient (r) tests. A statistical significance level of p\<0.05 will be accepted.

In addition, the project will be one of the first studies to investigate how intervention usage is associated with the outcomes over time, as well as explore best practices for future implementation and dissemination of such interventions by considering a variety of potential contexts. As such, the project is innovative, timely, and rigorous with sound scientific premise for helping to advance and bridge webapp HIV prevention science with existing community-level services.","The beginning of a relationship (i.e., within first year) is a crucial time for male couples to make decisions about their HIV/STI and sexual health needs. Via a recently completed nation-wide pilot RCT, the theoretically-grounded, couples-based app intervention showed high acceptability and feasibility, and strong promise for encouraging 42 male couples to create a tailored, prevention plan consisting of evidence-based strategies that aligned with the dyad's HIV serostatus. Retention was 86%, signifying that both partners of each couple completed all assessments, used the app intervention as designed, and participated in an individual-level exit interview. Acceptability was \>95%, and confirmed by using three different data sources (quantitative follow-up assessment, paradata from app intervention use, qualitative interview). The app intervention contained 4 modules (M1-M4) and a geo-locator sexual health resource finder. Although relationship partners individually used the app intervention (on their respective smartphones), questions and activities were built in each module to highlight within-couple comparisons and also encouraged couples to participate in discussion activities together. M1 was about enhancing communication and decision-making skills, while M2 focused on prevention strategies including creating a tailored prevention plan. M3 highlighted statistics of the HIV/STI epidemic, and M4 was about stigma and discrimination. Regarding promise, a two-fold increase was observed in the proportion of couples who created a tailored prevention plan when comparing baseline to follow-up assessment data, and while also considering their paradata. The next steps in this line of work would aim to improve the app intervention by integrating some of the acceptability feedback received, such as offering it in English and Spanish and adding content about importance of ART/PrEP adherence. Next steps also include, investigating - via mixed methods - how best to integrate the app intervention with local AIDS-service organizations (ASOs) and Community-based organizations (CBOs) for future scale up and improve use and adherence of evidence-based strategies among sexual minority men. Last but not least, a 4-month, Type 1 Hybrid Trial will be conducted to establish efficacy on couples' creation of a prevention plan, as well as participants' uptake of new evidence-based strategies (e.g., daily PrEP, regular testing, daily ART) and improving adherence of strategies currently in use.

People with reduced left ventricular EF are at increased risk for sudden death, ventricular and atrial arrhythmias, and acute hemodynamic decompensation due to heart failure. There are proven medical interventions that prevent sudden cardiac death and complications in people with decreased left ventricular EF. Unfortunately, some people with decreased left ventricular EF are asymptomatic, or have non-specific symptoms like dyspnea, and would not receive those interventions in a timely manner. Currently, there are no effective ways to screen for asymptomatic decreased left ventricular EF in the population, because detection of low EF requires the use of echocardiography. There is a significant need to identify novel technologies that can help to detect people with decreased left ventricular EF in a simple, effective, and reliable manner.

Eko Devices features a cloud-based platform of point-of-care cardiac screening devices and machine learning algorithms that enables more effective detection and management of cardiovascular disease. In this study, we will use the Eko DUO device to collect single-lead ECG data.

The Eko DUO is an FDA-cleared and CE-marked electronic stethoscope that allows audio recording of heart sound to produce a phonocardiogram (PCG) as well as recording a single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG). The DUO features 60x audio amplification, ambient noise reduction, a 4000Hz sample rate, and 4 audio filters. The ECG component is made up of 2 stainless steel electrodes, 0.01Hz high-pass filter, selectable 50/60Hz mains filter, and a 500Hz sample rate. The de-identified auscultatory DUO recordings transmit wirelessly via Bluetooth to the secure, HIPAA-compliant Eko application on a smartphone or tablet, which allows the user to playback heart sound recordings, annotate notes on recorded audio, and save recordings. This data is synced in real-time to a secure, HIPAA-compliant, cloud-based Amazon Web Services (AWS) database server managed by Eko Devices.

It has been previously demonstrated that artificial intelligence processing information from a 12-lead ECG can help to identify people with decreased left ventricular EF1.

Lophius kit T-Track® CMV represents a highly standardized and sensitive diagnostic tool to assess the functionality of a network of clinically relevant CMV-reactive effector cells. It is based on the stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with urea-formulated immunodominant CMV proteins, pp65 and IE-1, and the subsequent quantification of CMV-specific CMI (spot forming colonies) using a highly sensitive IFN-γ ELISpot.","Severe clinical complications including acute rejection and opportunistic infections in solid organ transplantation (SOT) are mainly caused by inadequate impairment of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) by immunosuppressive therapy. In particular CMV is responsible for increased morbidity and mortality revealing the need for either prophylactic or preemptive antiviral treatment. Recipients with negative CMV serology (R-) receiving a graft from a seropositive donor (D+) are at highest risk of developing CMV-associated complications. Therefore, these patients usually receive antiviral prophylaxis whereas patients at intermediate risk (D+/R+ or D-/R+) are treated either prophylactically or preemptively. Although prophylaxis is efficient, it is also accompanied by harmful side effects and high costs. Thus, there is a need for a personalized antiviral as well as immunosuppressive therapy to optimally treat the patient and to improve long-term patient and graft survival. The detection of a protective threshold of functional CMV-reactive cells may help to predict the onset of viral complications, thereby minimizing harmful side effects. Currently available tools to measure CMV-specific cellular immunity reveal striking limitations including a lack of standardization necessitating a commercially available standardized test system.

Although the perinatal period may be a time of greater risk for experiencing IPV, and greater vulnerability to PTSD symptomatology, a lack of research exists pertaining to the identification/treatment of IPV-related PTSD symptoms during this period. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, and employing a feminist, intersectional framework, the effectiveness of trauma-informed cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) among pregnant survivors of IPV experiencing PTSD symptomatology on depression, anxiety, PTSD and maternal-infant attachment will be explored.","IPV is a pervasive public health problem \[1\], with estimates of approximately 50% of Canadian women experiencing IPV at least once during their lifetime \[2\]. Some studies suggest that the perinatal period is a time of higher risk for experiencing IPV \[3-4\]. Numerous studies have linked women's experience of IPV with mental health concerns such as depression, anxiety and PTSD \[5-8\] and rates of PTSD are higher for perinatal women compared to the general population \[9-10\]. Prevalence rates of PTSD among survivors of IPV range from 31-84% \[7,11\].

The perinatal period may relate to greater risk for re-triggering of PTSD, given the physical/emotional changes, and the intimate/invasive nature of perinatal care. Additionally, the medicalized processes involved may contribute to feelings of powerlessness and vulnerability, further compromising at-risk women \[9\]. PTSD can alter psychological functioning and is associated with depression \[12\], disordered eating, substance abuse, sexual risk exposures and re-victimization \[13\] and failure to engage in health promotion strategies such as exercise, diet and routine health care \[14\]; all of which may exacerbate obstetrical risk. Furthermore, mental illness and trauma have been associated with infant prematurity, low birth weight and childhood developmental delays \[15\] in addition to adverse effects on maternal functioning such as maternal-child attachment \[15\]. As such, there are enormous personal and societal costs associated with PTSD related to IPV for childbearing women.

Recently, a significant gap in the literature was identified pertaining to the identification and treatment of IPV-related PTSD of childbearing women \[16\]. There is a critical need for individualized, trauma-informed care to facilitate optimal maternal and child attachment outcomes \[16\].

A diminished blood flow may cause chest pain (angina), shortness of breath or other symptoms. A complete blockage can cause a heart attack. Angioplasty and stenting techniques are safe and effective procedures performed to unblock coronary arteries. However, a recurrent problem after angioplasty is the occurrence of a new blockage, usually within 6 to 9 months after the initial procedure. This phenomenon, called ""restenosis"", is a body's response to the injury of the angioplasty and does not mean a progression of coronary artery disease.The pathophysiology of restenosis is complex and has as yet not been fully clarified.

Serial studies have shown that in-stent restenosis is almost exclusively caused by neointimal hyperplasia and tissue proliferation occurring in site or adjacent to the stent sites. Histological studies confirmed that neointimal hyperplasia post-stent implantation is related to vessel injury during the procedure. Chemokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular injury. In this context, MCP-1 which shows a potent chemotactic action on monocytes, can amplify the inflammatory response through the recruitment of additional monocytes. In addition, MCP-3 is known to share some key biological features with MCP-1. It has been proved that MCP-1 directly induces human vascular smooth muscle proliferation acting at this level as a potent mitogen, and that anti-MCP-1 gene therapy inhibits restenotic changes (neointimal hyperplasia) in animals after balloon injury.

An evidence of a critical increase in circulating MCP-1 after coronary angioplasty was reported. It was more evident and prolonged in patients with restenosis rather than in non-restenotic patients, in which only a transient increases in plasma MCP-1 has been demonstrated.

Since these chemokines showed to play a main role in the appearance and worsening of the restenosis process, a selective inhibitor of MCP-1 and other members of monocyte chemotactic protein subfamily of CC inflammatory chemokines (MCP-3/CCL7, MCP-2/CCL8), such as bindarit, may have a potential therapeutic use in preventing restenosis by inhibiting the VSMC proliferation, and without affecting the important process of re-endothelization.",Aziende Chimiche Riunite Angelini Francesco S.p.A,INDUSTRY,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,148.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,PREVENTION,,,TRIPLE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Data from our recent open-label, 8-week pilot study provided the first evidence of these effects in depressed patients, with significant improvements observed in overall mood, anhedonia, and sleep quality. To further support this evidence and expand upon the search for biomarkers in depression, data from this pilot study is being used to plan a 16-week, double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial to assess the effects of probiotics on depression. Participants diagnosed with depression recruited from the greater Kingston area will orally consume a probiotic supplement containing Lactobacillus helveticus and Bifidobacterium longum (Probio'Stick, Lallemand Health Solutions) or placebo once daily. Participants will undergo clinical assessments measuring mood, anxiety, cognition, and sleep using a battery of validated clinical scales to assess efficacy of the probiotic alleviating depressive symptoms; sleep will also be assessed objectively with an ambulatory polysomnogram. Neuroimaging data will be collected using magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography to look at functional, structural, and electrical changes in the brain associated with consumption of the probiotic. Molecular data will be collected from blood, stool, and urine samples to look at levels of cytokines and serotonin, and explore potential genes and proteins that may predict outcomes in depression. An informatics-based approach will be used to integrate clinical, neuroimaging, and molecular data to look for biomarkers that indicate disease state and predict antidepressant-like response to the probiotic.

5f9827769f69a55d,NCT00412386,Abnormal 3-D MRI Flow Patterns in Adolescents Patients With Bicuspid Aortic Valve,Abnormal 3-dimensional MRI Flow Patterns and Plasma Matrix Metalloproteinase Levels Predict Dilatation of Ascending Aorta in Adolescent Patients With Bicuspid Aortic Valve,,IRB00000134,"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a form of congenital heart disease (the person is born with it). With BAV, the heart valves in the aorta (the blood vessel that takes blood away from the heart to the body) are not formed right. A person with BAV has only 2 leaflets instead of three and the valve leaflets are often thickened. This can result in the block of blood flow across the valve (aortic stenosis) and/or valve leakage (aortic valve regurgitation).

From our experience at least 1/3 of patients with BAV will eventually develop complications. Many patients with BAV do not develop significant problems until well into adulthood. The most common problem in BAV patients is aortic dilatation and/or dissection. At this point, we do not know on who or why aortic dilatation or dissection occurs.It is unclear whether the enlargement is because of abnormal blood flow patterns, as a result of the shape of the bicuspid valve, or whether it is because the way the aortic valve and/or vessel is formed. In other words, the abnormal shape of the aortic valve may cause blood to flow in a different way than it normally would, causing damage to the aorta as blood leaves the heart. There may be a problem with the way the aortic valve connects to the aorta, which causes the aorta to get larger or break down over time. It is also possible that the wall of the aorta in patients with BAV is weaker than it would be in patients without BAV. At this point, we do not know. It is believed by the investigators that if we can determine why the aorta gets larger or tears, we can minimize the effects or prevent them altogether.

This study will collect blood and cardiac MRI images from forty-five (45) patients at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Egleston. There will be a study group (patients with BAV) and a control group of patients (patients scheduled for a cardiac MRI but without BAV).

All enrolled patients will have blood drawn by nursing staff from a peripheral vein and collected in tubes for testing the day of their MRI scan. This test is called a plasma matrix metalloproteinase level. It is believed that patients who have bicuspid aortic valves and dilated aortas have high plasma levels of this protein. This study will compare the MRI images and plasma matrix protein levels of all the patients participating in the study.","Introduction-Background The reported incidence of bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) based largely on autopsy studies varies between 0.4% to 2.25% of the population. At least a third of patients with a bicuspid aortic valve will eventually develop complications which include aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, infective endocarditis, aortic dilatation, aortic aneurysm formation, or aortic dissection. Given that in combination all other forms of congenital heart disease are thought to be present in 0.8% of live births, Ward has suggested that bicuspid aortic valves are likely to result in more morbidity and possibly mortality than the effects of all other congenital heart defects combined. Since many patients with bicuspid aortic valves do not develop significant problems until well into adulthood, clinicians have not focused much attention on the ""normally"" functioning bicuspid aortic valve. However, at a mean age of 17.8 years 52% of males with normally functioning aortic valves already have aortic dilatation, implying that associated aortic stenosis and/or regurgitation is not an obligate precursor.

Previous studies have demonstrated an association between bicuspid aortic valves and dilatation of the aorta. Gurvitz et al. performed echocardiographic measurements of the aortas of children and found that those with bicuspid aortic valves had significantly larger aortas compared with controls, regardless of the presence of aortic stenosis or regurgitation. Nevertheless, the definition of clinical predictors of the risk for the development of aortic dilatation/dissection and an understanding of the mechanisms leading to aortic dilatation are lacking. Specifically, it remains unclear as yet whether such dilatation is secondary to abnormal flow patterns and shear stresses resulting from the bicuspid valve morphology or whether it is a manifestation of a distinct underlying structural problem with not only the aortic valve but also the aortic root including the ascending aorta.

Fernandes et al. recently reviewed the echocardiograms of 1,135 children with bicuspid aortic valves and found that there were differences among the patients related to aortic valve morphology. For instance, associated moderate or greater aortic stenosis was present in 9.7% of patients with fusion of the intercoronary commissure of the aortic valve, vs 25.9% of patients with fusion of the right-coronary and non-coronary commissure, and in none of the patients with fusion of the left coronary and non-coronary aortic valve leaflets. Moreover, fusion of the right coronary and non-coronary cusps resulted in a two-fold higher risk of at least moderate aortic regurgitation compared with the other types of bicuspid aortic valves. However, this generalized division of bicuspid aortic valves into three types based on which commissure is fused is likely an oversimplification, and Fernandes did not report on the relationship between valve morphology and aortic root dilatation. However, Novaro et al. found that adult patients (mean age of 54 year) with fusion of the right/non-coronary commissure tended to have larger mid-ascending aortas compared with patients with fusion of the intercoronary commissure, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Nevertheless, both personal clinical observations and recent publications support the assertion that individual bicuspid aortic valves may function quite differently from one another. For instance, there are bicuspid aortic valves in which there are two nearly symmetric leaflets whereas others may have a dominant cusp to varying degrees, resulting in a markedly eccentric orifice when the valve opens. In an elegant experimental model using excised bicuspid valves analyzed with intravascular ultrasound and high-resolution videography, Robicsek et al demonstrated that asymmetric bicuspid valves ""induced extensive recirculation vortices in the ascending aorta."" They found that the vortex was not ""trapped"" in the sinuses of Valsalva as it is in a normal tricuspid aortic valve, but instead is extended into the ascending aorta and aimed toward the right anterolateral aspect of the aorta (the convexity of the aorta). This correlates with published reports and our own personal experience in performing clinical cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) studies on patients with bicuspid aortic valves and aortic root dilatation in whom there is oft-noted asymmetry in the pattern of dilatation of the ascending aorta and resulting in an oval-shaped rather than a circular aortic root and ascending aorta.

Extrapolating from the studies of Robicsek, variations present in the geometry of bicuspid valves are likely to result in varying degrees of turbulence even in the absence aortic valve stenosis. In theory, the turbulent blood flow directed at a particular segment of the aortic wall may result in local changes to the aortic wall leading to asymmetric aortic dilatation. These changes are postulated to result from receptors present on both endothelial and smooth muscle cells that have the ability to adapt to sheer stress by altering local gene expression which in turn modulates the tension between focal adhesion sites, integrins, and the extracellular matrix. Moreover, fibrillin-1, which is deficient in patients with dilated aortic roots and Marfan syndrome, has also been found to be deficient in the aortas of patients with bicuspid aortic valves. Similarly, Cotrufo et al. found asymmetric patterns of matrix protein expression and content and asymmetric patterns of elastic medial wall degeneration in the aortic walls of patients with bicuspid aortic valves. In addition, these investigators found differences between patients with bicuspid aortic valves and associated stenosis vs regurgitation, suggesting that focally-directed aortic turbulence may be influencing local gene expression and potentially explaining the asymmetric pattern of aortic dilatation that is often observed. Lastly, several recent studies have highlighted the relationship between circulating plasma MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels either in aortic dilatation in adult patients with thoracic or abdominal aortic aneurysms or in adults with aortic dilatation secondary to systemic hypertension. In addition, histologic examination of aortic aneurysm tissue in adult patients with bicuspid aortic valves demonstrated increased MMP-2 expression vs. aortic aneurysms in adults with trileaflet aortic valves.

Recently investigators have used cardiac MRI (CMR) to study flow patterns in the aorta. CMR is a noninvasive technique that permits 3-dimensional anatomic characterization as well as assessment of aortic flow. Markl et al. have used time-resolved 3-dimensional phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (3D-PCMRI) techniques to characterize aortic flow in both normal adults and in adults after aortic root replacement. These authors established that 3-dimensional magnetic resonance velocity mapping was a useful technique to visualize and qualitatively assess the complex aortic flow patterns in both normal controls and in patients with aortic pathology. Similarly, Kvitting et al., who studied both adult volunteers and 2 patients with Marfan syndrome following aortic valve sparing operations, found that the alterations to the normal aortic sinus architecture following surgery resulted in a loss of the normal vortical flow patterns seen in the aortic sinuses.

Specific Aims

1. Develop clinically feasible MRI imaging strategies to perform a complete evaluation of structure and functional dynamics of the heart, including the aortic valve, aortic root, and ascending aorta, as well as full volumetric 3-D ciné flow velocity encoding of the entire aortic root region and proximal ascending aorta.
2. Define qualitative and quantitative metrics to characterize different types of bicuspid aortic valve morphology and flow patterns. These metrics will be based on structural information and the blood flow patterns in the aortic root, observed in MRI studies of patients with diagnosed bicuspid aortic valves, as compared to observation in control subjects with known normal aortic valves and anatomy of ascending aorta.
3. Correlate different bicuspid aortic valve morphologies and observed characteristic flow patterns with the risk of development of aortic dilatation at various levels of the aorta, such as the aortic root, proximal ascending aorta, and distal ascending aorta.
4. Quantify plasma concentrations of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels as well as the levels of their specific tissue inhibitors, respectively tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) in controls and bicuspid aortic valve patients.
5. Correlate biochemical markers of extracellular matrix degradation (both MMP and TIMP) with the presence or absence of aortic dilatation in both controls and in patients with bicuspid aortic valves.

Study Design We will prospectively perform cardiac magnetic resonance studies on 30 patients, ages 10-18 years with known bicuspid aortic valves (BAV), and on 15 normal control subjects. The BAV patient population will consist of 15 patients with aortic root dilatation for body surface area as determined by published pediatric echocardiographic normal values and 15 without aortic dilatation. Echocardiographic normals indexed for body surface area will be used, as there are no published normal CMR values for aortic dimensions in pediatric patients using cine MR techniques; however aortic measurements by echocardiography and CMR in a pediatric patient population have been shown to reveal no significant differences except for the descending aorta. Since either significant aortic stenosis or regurgitation has been associated with aortic dilatation, patients will be excluded if they have more than mild stenosis or regurgitation.

As in previous published reports, mild aortic stenosis will be classified as a mean gradient across the aortic valve \<17 mmHg on routine clinical echocardiography. Mild aortic regurgitation will be defined on routine clinical echocardiography as resulting in a left ventricular end-diastolic dimension \<2 standard deviations below the mean for body surface area and the absence of pan-diastolic retrograde flow on pulsed Doppler evaluation of the abdominal descending aorta. Studies will be performed without sedation, but with breath-holding instructions as appropriate.

Controls will consist of 15 patients with normal aortic valves and aortas who are undergoing clinically indicated CMR studies for reasons such as chest pain or assessment for cardiomyopathy and who are found to have structurally/functionally normal hearts.

MRI Methods Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) studies will be performed in a GE 1.5 T MR system with Release 12M4 cardiovascular software. MR imaging will focus on of visualization in high definition of the anatomy of the aortic valve and aortic root utilizing 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional FIESTA cine MR sequences. Flow data will be acquired using 2-dimensional, or, whenever allowed within imaging time constraints, fully 3-dimensional phase velocity mapping sequences with full vector-encoding of velocities at 200 cm/s maximum velocity encoding VENC, adjusted up if velocity aliasing is observed. For 2-D flow acquisitions in planes across the main flow direction the in-plane directional components may be acquired at lower velocity encoding to achieve higher accuracy. To resolve blood flow and cardiovascular anatomy as a function of the cardiac phase (cine imaging), image acquisition will be synchronized with the vector cardiogram to reconstruct approximately 16-20 cine images representing the different phases of the cardiac cycle. Initial data acquisition for structural and velocity-encoded imaging will be performed with standard pulse sequence software as supplied by General Electric with the imaging device. These scans will initially be acquired in free-breathing mode. A series of 5-10 studies on normal volunteers will be conducted to optimize the protocol within those constraints, and develop guidelines for an prescribed add-on imaging protocol, ideally limited to not more than 20 minutes of scan time, for acquisition of the aortic scans. Priority solutions for respiratory motion compensation during the acquisition depending on the demonstrated reliability of the available options (free-breathing, breath-holding, respiratory k-space ordering, navigator- or belt \& bellows-monitored respiratory gating) in these volunteer test studies, and based on the capability of each study subject to accommodate these options. The scans defined in this protocol will be added initially to the clinical protocol of all subjects in the study. In parallel with the protocol development and implementation by standards pulse sequence methods, we will pursue a collaboration effort with the MRI imaging resource center at Stanford University. The Stanford group has developed a highly optimized image acquisition method which allows fully vector-encoded 3-D respiration-ordered acquisition of an arbitrarily positioned rectangular 3-D imaging volume. We anticipate that this acquisition software, which will require running specialized pulse sequence software and off-line image reconstruction on one of our computer workstations, will improve the coverage and overall resolution of the flow-encoded data significantly. We have the required expertise and research software tools available from General Electric, but currently only enabled for research on the WCI scanner at Emory. For this project, but possibly concurrently with transition of software development efforts for other research projects (Noquist project) we will request authorization from GE to run the required research patches on the Egleston 1.5T GE instrument.

Plasma MMP and TIMP quantification methods Blood samples will be taken from peripheral veins by nursing staff.MMP and TIMP levels will then be measured using commercially available sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits which have previously been validated for use in human tissue homogenates.Serum MMP levels will be determined using MMP-2 and MMP-9 monoclonal antibodies.Levels of TIMP-1 and -2 will be determined using monoclonal antibodies.

Image Processing Methods Visualization and quantitative analysis of velocity mapping data will be performed, initially exclusively, utilizing in-house HeartViz software developed by Marijn Brummer, Ph.D.The current version of the software allows fully interactive 3-D dynamic integrated display of structural information through texture-mapped slice display and time-resolved volume rendering, in conjunction with dynamic flow vector field visualization from multiple flow acquisitions in the same view.

A surplus in energy intake might result in body fat deposition and thereby body weight gain. Therefore, food intake regulation is crucial to control the body weight gain.

Appetite regulation plays an important role in determining the food intake, which is a complex process influenced by the individual (physiology and psychology) and environment. Satiation (process that leads to the termination of eating) and satiety (decline in hunger, increase in fullness after a meal has finished) are the precursors of appetite regulation, which may be induced by various food components such as macronutrients, water, alcohol and non-digestible polysaccharides. High viscosity and swellable/bulking food components such as dietary fibre are expected to elicit stronger satiation/satiety than the macronutrients or clear liquid. Due to its unique physicochemical properties, dietary fibre has been recognized as potential ingredient that helps to enhance the sensation of satiety in the upper gut by increasing gastric distension and delaying gastric emptying, which subsequently reduces the food intake.

IQP-AK-102 comprises of a proprietary blend of dietary fibres known to promote a feeling a fullness. The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IQP-AK-102 on appetite reduction in overweight subjects during a 4-weeks interval.",,InQpharm Group,INDUSTRY,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,36.0,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,,TREATMENT,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

This study examines whether this intervention might improve treatment outcomes for people with substance use disorders. The intervention, called Laddr®, is a smartphone application (""app"") that provides information and skills that can help people stop using substances. The social version of Laddr® being tested in this study has new features that allow people in treatment for substance use disorders to include a support person in their treatment journey, including a friend, family member, or other acquaintance. This research study will compare the effectiveness of Laddr® in combination with standard outpatient substance use treatment to standard treatment only for substance use disorders.","Digital therapeutics, or software used to prevent, treat, or manage a medical disorder or disease, are redefining the future of healthcare by providing on-demand access to state-of-the-science care. Digital therapeutics have been developed to treat a wide range of disorders, including substance use disorders (SUD). Developed by the study Principal Investigator (PI) and Co-Investigator (Co-I), Laddr® is a unique mobile platform integrating science-based therapeutic processes to address a wide range of behavioral problems, including SUD.

The current project expands Laddr® to allow users to engage a support network of their choosing in their journey of behavioral change. Individuals can share data from Laddr about their successes and challenges, and their support network can offer anytime/anywhere social support. Social support will be embedded within a strongly science-based digital therapeutic process - thus providing support persons with a clear framework in which to offer support. Research has shown that engaging a support network of non-substance users (e.g., family members, friends) in one's SUD treatment can greatly enhance treatment outcomes - and is aligned with the ""community reinforcement"" tenet of the CRA treatment model. Interventions that leverage social support networks can help keep individuals engaged in treatment, reinforce their successes, and help them troubleshoot challenges.

This pragmatic, randomized controlled trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the social version of Laddr® in improving SUD treatment outcomes. Adults entering outpatient SUD treatment at the Farnum Center in Manchester, New Hampshire (NH) will be offered the opportunity to be randomized to 12 weeks of standard treatment (treatment as usual \[TAU\] arm), or standard treatment plus the social version of Laddr® (Laddr® arm). The primary study outcome is retention in SUD treatment (time to treatment dropout), and the investigators hypothesize that participants receiving Laddr® will be retained in treatment for a longer duration.

Total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA and TKA) are now procedures where patients can be sent home on the same day of the surgical procedure. However, this requires substantial knowledge of factors affecting the length of hospital stay. In this prospective, observational cohort study, we will investigate factors that affect the duration of spinal anaesthesia which is often used in THA and TKA. The aim is to gather enough data to be able to determine how local anaesthetic volume and dose affect the duration of spinal anaesthesia. This will enable us to decide whether spinal anaesthesia is a good option when performing TKA and THA in an ambulatory setting.","With the increasing health care cost and the scarcity of nursing staff, there is considerable focus on providing surgery in an ambulatory setting. Total hip and knee arthroplasty (THA and TKA) are now procedures where selected patients are sent home on the same day after the procedure. Therefore, knowledge of key factors affecting the length of stay is important. One factor is the method of anaesthesia used for the operative procedure.

Spinal anaesthesia is often used for THA and TKA and has several advantages compared to general anaesthesia. However, spinal anaesthesia also has drawbacks, because it reduces the force in the legs, hindering early mobilisation. There are no good data on the duration of spinal anaesthesia. Compared to the past, there has been a shift towards using lower doses of local anaesthetic (LA) injected into the subarachnoid space. Theoretically, this should result in a shorter duration of anaesthesia, and this would be of value in an ambulatory setting. However, if the variation in the duration is high and therefore not predictable for the individual patient, spinal anaesthesia has limitations in the ambulatory setting.

The objective of the present study is to prospectively collect data on the type and dose of LA injected into the subarachnoid space and the duration of spinal anaesthesia in participants scheduled for orthopaedic surgery in spinal anaesthesia. We hypothesise that the mean duration of spinal anaesthesia is positively correlated to the dose of LA injected into the subarachnoid space.",Nordsjaellands Hospital,OTHER,SPONSOR,OBSERVATIONAL,True,ESTIMATED,2000.0,,,,,COHORT,PROSPECTIVE,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Although guidelines exist, they are not implemented as such in the Belgian health care system. General practitioners (GPs) are confronted with the broadest range of HF management. Therefore, a multifaceted intervention will be implemented in Belgian general practice to support GPs in the implementation of evidence-based HF guidelines. This multifaceted intervention will consist of audit and feedback as a method to detect unrecognized HF patients and increase awareness for proactive HF management. Additionally, a NT-proBNP point-of-care test will be offered to every practice to improve detection and adequate diagnosis of HF patients. Furthermore, a specialist HF nurse will assist GPs in education of patients, optimization of treatment and transition of care. The investigators' aim is evaluating the feasibility of the implementation of this multifaceted intervention in general practice and the evolution in predefined quality indicators.","Objectives:

The objective of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of a multifaceted intervention to optimize care for HF patients in Belgian general practice. It is not a primary objective to study the effectiveness of the intervention on the defined outcomes, since follow-up might be too short, however the evolution in quality will be evaluated. Specific research questions are:

1. Do general practitioners use the NT-proBNP POC test and how does it influence practice?
2. Do general practitioners use the assistance of the HF nurse and how does it influence practice?
3. Does this intervention improve quality of care for HF patients in primary care?
4. Does this intervention improve quality of life for HF patients in primary care?
5. Is this intervention/data collection method feasible? How do participating GPs and investigators experience the interventions?

Data collection:

* Measurements at baseline and after 6 months of follow-up
* Baseline demographic data on patient age, gender, years since the diagnosis of HF, cardiovascular comorbidities (hypertension, ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease), non-cardiovascular comorbidities (diabetes, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia), the last two blood pressure measurements, last 2 creatinine measurements and the last two values of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), last date of GP consultation, involvement of cardiologist (yes/no), last date of cardiologist appointment, echocardiography (yes/no), last date of echocardiography report, ejection fraction (EF), diastolic dysfunction (yes/no), clinically relevant valvular dysfunction (yes/no), left ventricular hypertrophy (yes/no), left atrial enlargement (yes/no) and heart failure treatment with dosage (diuretics, ACE-I, ARB, B-blockers, MRA, digoxin) will be collected. Additionally, the number of chronic medications and the number of chronic comorbidities will be collected. Furthermore, the MLHF-Q will be collected to evaluate patients' quality of life and grip strength (only at baseline) as a predictor of functional decline, disability and mortality. At baseline, HF hospitalization during the last three years will be registered based on discharge letters in the EHR. All hospitalizations and mortality will be collected at practice level during the study course. Data on physician age, gender, years of experience and practice organization (group/single-handed/number of practitioners/EMHS) will be requested as well.

Patient level

Outcomes:

All data will be extracted from the EHR of the general practitioner for all patients who satisfy the eligibility criteria. Data will be extracted at baseline and after 6 months. First, at baseline and after 6 months, all patients with a registered diagnosis of HF will be identified in the EMHS. Demographic data can be extracted with an automated search; other data will need to be collected by manual chart review. Additionally, all identified HF patients will be visited by the HF nurse at baseline and after 6 months and will be asked to fill in the MLHF-Q. At this occasion grip strength will be measured in the dominant hand using a JAMAR® Plus digital hand-held dynamometer. Three attempts at maximal squeeze will be recorded.

Process evaluation:

GPs will be asked to fill in a study registration form about the indication and results of their NT-proBNP POC test use and how it influenced their decision-making. The HF nurse will keep a log of all actions. Consequence of these actions will be collected from the patients' medical record. GPs will be asked to take note of the HF nurse advice in the EHR and indicate if it influenced decision-making.

Experiences of GPs and investigators:

The feedback meeting at 6 months will be organized as a focus group in each GP practice to get more insight in the experiences of the participating physicians and investigators. The meetings will be audiotaped and typed out. Any harm as a result of the trial will be explicitly collected and reported.

Practice level

Impact of the intervention on hospitalizations and mortality cannot be studied in this pilot trial, however, in a later stage this would be the outcome in the larger cluster-randomized trial, therefore, the feasibility of collecting data on hospitalizations and mortality will be tested. These outcomes will be measured at practice level in all patients aged 40 years or older, enlisted in one of the participating GP practices. GPs will be asked to register date of death and cause of death in the EHR of all patients who die during the study course. A list of hospitalized patients of each participating GP will be collected in all the surrounding hospitals (ZOL Genk, AZ Vesalius, Jessa Hasselt) and handed over to the GPs. Cause of hospitalization will be deducted from the discharge letter in the EHR by the GP in a standardized manner (trained by principal investigator (PI)). The anonymized data will be handed over to the PI.

Data management:

Data collection and data entries will be done by the PI and an assisting data manager. All patient data will be coded and anonymized. All other authors will have full access to the coded data (including statistical reports and tables) in the study and will be able to take responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the data analysis.

Data analysis:

Descriptive statistics will be provided regarding baseline variables of the HF patients and general practitioners/general practices. Outcomes measured before and after the study intervention will be compared with a chi-squared test. Experiences of participating GPs and investigators will be analyzed qualitatively using thematic analysis as method.

Ethics:

Before the study start the investigators will present the participating physicians with an informed consent that outlines the intervention and the purpose of the trial. Additionally, all identified HF patients will be visited by the HF nurse before the start of the study. On that occasion the HF nurse will inform all HF patients about the study outline and purpose and ask informed consent. Furthermore, patients eligible for a NT-proBNP POC test will be informed by their GPs about the study outline and purpose and asked informed consent. However, informed consent cannot be sought for all patients on practice level (hospitalizations/mortality). Therefore, information about the study intervention and purpose of the trial will be presented on a poster in each practice, visible for all patients, who can opt-out if they object to study participation.",KU Leuven,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,538.0,NON_RANDOMIZED,SINGLE_GROUP,,OTHER,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

For those patients, hypoglycemia is a common adverse event, which is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Bedside capillary point-of-care (POC) glucose monitoring is the standard of care to assess glycemic control in the hospital. However, POC glucose testing only provides glucose measurements at specific time points, leading to missed information important for glycemic control. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) measures interstitial glucose every 5 min, thus providing a more complete glycemic profile during a 24 h period compared with standard POC glucose testing.

The cloud-based real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) and management system was previously observed to be safe and effective in guiding intensive insulin therapy. Therefore, this CGM intergraded system holds promise for improving glucose control in patients with diabetes during hospitalization. However, it is currently unclear if alerts are the main reason for the better outcome in the RT-CGM groups, or rather the fact that sensor values are available in real-time. Moreover, the current system provided the feature of predictive threshold alerts that could alert before the onset of clinical hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.

Paradoxical TB-IRIS occurs in 8- 43% of patients starting ART while on TB treatment and results in morbidity, hospitalisation, consumes health care resources and TB-IRIS may be fatal. We have previously demonstrated in a clinical trial that prednisone reduces morbidity when used for treatment of paradoxical TB-IRIS. This trial is a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of prophylactic prednisone (40mg/day for 2 weeks followed by 20mg/day for 2 weeks, started on the same day as ART) in patients with TB who are identified as being at high risk for paradoxical TB-IRIS (starting ART within 30 days of initiating TB treatment and CD4 \< 100/μL). The trial will enroll 240 participants, randomised 1:1 (prednisone:placebo). The primary endpoint is development of paradoxical TB-IRIS, defined using international consensus case definitions. Secondary endpoints include time to IRIS event, severity of IRIS, quality of life assessment, mortality and corticosteroids adverse events. The trial is powered to determine a reduction in TB-IRIS events.","Objective: To determine whether the addition of prednisone to the first 4 weeks of antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces the risk of paradoxical TB-IRIS in HIV-infected patients being treated for TB who are at high risk of developing TB-IRIS (CD4 \<100 cells/μl and starting ART within 30 days of TB treatment).

Design: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the incidence of paradoxical TB-IRIS over the first 12 weeks of ART in participants who receive a 4 week course of prednisone versus participants who receive a 4 week course of placebo.

Primary efficacy endpoint:

The development of paradoxical TB-IRIS within 12 weeks of starting ART (defined using the International Network for the Study of HIV-associated IRIS (INSHI) consensus case definition).

Secondary efficacy endpoints:

1. Time to IRIS event
2. Severity of IRIS events (defined by the following: need for hospitalisation for IRIS, C-reactive protein, and neurological involvement)
3. Duration of TB-IRIS event (from onset of symptoms/signs to resolution of TB-IRIS symptoms/signs)
4. Mortality attributed to TB and TB-IRIS
5. All-cause mortality
6. Composite endpoint of death, hospitalization, or hepatotoxicity (using the protocol-specified definition of Grade 3 or 4 increase in ALT or bilirubin).
7. Other (non-TB) IRIS events
8. Quality of life assessment (measured using PROQOL-HIV, EQ-5D-3L, HIV symptom index and Karnofsky score)
9. Adverse events and severe adverse events ascribed to TB treatment, ART or co-trimoxazole. This will include a pre-specified analysis of drug-induced liver injury and drug rash. This assessment will include the number of treatment interruptions for drug adverse events.
10. Discontinuation of either ART or TB treatment for \> 5 days due to adverse events
11. Number of hospitalizations and total days hospitalized

Safety and tolerability endpoints:

1. Corticosteroid-associated adverse events, classified by severity and relation to study drug. These will include hypertension, hyperglycaemia, hypomania/mania, depression, acne, epigastric pain, upper gastro-intestinal bleeding, Cushingoid features, new oedema and avascular bone necrosis.
2. Laboratory safety data: glucose, full blood count and electrolytes
3. Other infections (AIDS-related, bacterial, fungal and viral) and malignancies (Kaposi's sarcoma)
4. All grade 1, 2, 3 and 4 adverse events (clinical and laboratory using the ACTG grading system)

Sample size: 240 participants will be enrolled over 13 months. Each participant will be followed for 12 weeks.

Population: HIV-infected, ART-naïve adult (≥ 18 years) patients diagnosed with active tuberculosis who have a CD4 \< 100 cells/μL and who start ART within 30 days of starting TB treatment. Other inclusion criteria include: diagnosis of TB (smear, culture, Xpert MTB/RIF test, histology or strong clinical and radiological evidence of TB with symptomatic response to TB treatment), eligible for and consent to starting ART and written informed consent for trial. Exclusion criteria include: Kaposi's sarcoma, pregnancy, TB meningitis or tuberculoma at TB diagnosis (because these patients receive corticosteroids), known rifampicin-resistant TB, being on corticosteroids for another indication within the past 7 days, on other immunosuppressive medication within the past 7 days and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus.

TB treatment and ART: TB treatment will be prescribed and monitored by the clinical staff in the local HIV-TB clinic. TB treatment will be given according to South African Department of Health guidelines. This involves rifampicin (R), isoniazid (H), ethambutol (E) and pyrazinamide (Z) for 2 months followed by RH for 4 months. ART will be prescribed by the clinical staff at the HIV-TB clinic according to South African Department of Health guidelines. Standard first line ART in TB patients is tenofovir, emtricitabine (or lamivudine) and efavirenz. Co-trimoxazole prophylaxis will be prescribed to all patients unless a contra-indication exists.

Intervention: Oral prednisone 40mg daily for 14 doses started on the first day that ART is taken, followed by 20mg daily for 14 doses (or identical placebo). A total of 28 days of study medication will thus be prescribed.

Follow-up: Patients will be screened once established on TB treatment, but before starting ART. If the patient is eligible, written informed consent will be taken. There will be six planned study visits that will be in relation to the start of ART: week 0 (the day ART is initiated), week 1, week 2, week 4, week 8 and week 12. Patients will be seen at unscheduled visits if clinical deterioration occurs. If paradoxical TB-IRIS is diagnosed this will be treated with open label prednisone at clinician discretion if symptoms are moderate or severe. If patients experience clinical complications (eg. TB-IRIS) follow-up will be prolonged beyond week 12 in order to stabilize their condition before referral back to the general TB-HIV clinical service for ongoing management.

Data monitoring: The trial will be monitored by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) comprising 3 independent researchers and an independent statistician. After an initial meeting for agreeing on their Charter, the DSMB will meet twice (after 80 and 160 participants have completed follow-up) to review data quality and data with respect to safety and trial endpoints. If there is evidence of harm related to study medication or trial conduct the DSMB may advise the sponsor that trial enrollment should be stopped.

It can alter the patients' balance, mobility, as well as their quality of life (QoL). The available therapeutic strategies for treating spasticity and related symptoms are usually faced with limited efficacy and numerous side effects. For these reasons, non-invasive stimulation techniques, namely transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation using EXOPULSE Mollii suit, might be of help in this context.","This work will assess the effects of the EXOPULSE Mollii suit, which is an assistance device applying non-invasive transcutaneous electrostimulation. The EXOPULSE Mollii control unit is a class IIa device, CE marked, and therefore compliant with the Medical Device Directive. Its intended use includes relaxing spastic muscles, maintaining or increasing the range of movement, activating and re-educating muscles, delaying or preventing atrophy due to disuse, increasing local blood flow, and symptomatic relief and management of chronic refractory pain.

The available interventions targeting spasticity are faced with some limitations. For instance, botulinum toxin injection does not seem to improve arm and hand capacity, walking, or quality of life. The available oral agents are challenged by their potential side effects, such as sedation, drowsiness, mental confusion, fatigue, ataxia, hallucination, insomnia, nausea, dry mouth, bradycardia, hypotension, and depression, to cite a few. Therefore, developing novel therapies would help to overcome the actual limitations. Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) has proven some efficacy in spasticity management. However, one should note that practical difficulties could arise when using TENS at home or in clinical practice (i.e., correctly attaching electrodes). To overcome these limitations, the EXOPULSE Mollii suit has been developed by Exoneural Network, a Swedish med-tech company. It represents an innovative approach for non-invasive electro-stimulation to reduce spasticity and improve motor function.

EXOPULSE Mollii suits consist of body Garments (Jacket and Pants) and a control unit. The body Garments (Jacket and Pants) is a suit with 58 embedded electrodes that can stimulate 40 groups of muscles, conductive wires, and connectors to a detachable control unit, whose intended purpose is to transmit electric pulses from the control unit to key nerves and corresponding muscle groups throughout the body. The control unit is a battery-powered electrical device that sends low-intensity electric pulses through connectors to the Body Garments which in turn transmits the pulses from the connectors to key nerves and corresponding muscle groups throughout the body.

EXOPULSE Mollii suit consists of transcutaneously stimulating the spastic antagonist muscles with an electric current (i.e., low frequency \~20 Hz, low intensity\~2 mA), aiming to reduce muscle stiffness. This treatment method's theoretical background primarily refers to the concept of reciprocal inhibition, i.e., that sensory input from a muscle may inhibit the activation of an antagonistic muscle. Thus, the application of the EXOPULSE Mollii suit aims to stimulate a muscle, e.g., the anterior tibialis muscle to reduce reflex-mediated over-activity (i.e., spasticity) of calf muscles by inducing reciprocal inhibition.

There is growing evidence now from pilot applications of EXOPULSE Mollii suit indicating beneficial effects of using this suit on activity (i.e., mobility and gross motor function) and participation.",Institut De La Colonne Vertebrale Et Des Neurosciences,OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,32.0,RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,"The investigators designes a randomized crossover, sham-controlled, double- blind trial to demonstrate the improvement of motor functions and cerebral palsy related symptoms following two weeks of daily sessions of ""active"" versus ""sham"" EXOPULSE Mollii suit.

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Epacadostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pembrolizumab and epacadostat may work better compared to usual treatment (surgery, radiation, or cytotoxic chemotherapy) in treating patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. To assess the objective tumor response (proportion of objective response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors \[RECIST\] 1.1 criteria) of the combination of pembrolizumab (MK-3475 \[pembrolizumab\]) and epacadostat in patients with recurrent or persistent clear cell carcinoma of the ovary.

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) + epacadostat as assessed by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) in patients with recurrent or persistent clear cell carcinoma of the ovary.

II. To estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients treated with combination of MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) and epacadostat.

EXPLORATORY TRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVES:

I. Determine whether the ratio of plasma tryptophan to kynurenine (T:K) correlates with response to MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) + epacadostat, by evaluating plasma T:K pre-treatment, during treatment, and at disease progression.

II. Determine whether the presence of PD-L1, IDO-1, tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells (Tregs), CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I in the tumor microenvironment at baseline correlates with objective response to MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) + epacadostat.

III. Determine whether soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) levels in plasma are correlated with response to MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) + epacadostat, by evaluating sPD-L1 concentrations pre-treatment, during treatment, and at disease progression.

The fetal group hypothesis is to perform a minimally invasive procedure using a fetoscopic technique in order to access to amniotic cavity and make the endoscopic repair. This approach will allow investigators to make the closure of the defect and avoid the use of an hysterotomy, reducing the risk of maternal complications as uterine dehiscence (rupture), hemorrhage and preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), the patient also will be able to have a vaginal delivery.","Spina bifida can be a devastating neurological congenital anomaly . It results from incomplete middleline closure of the neural tube between 22 and 28 embryological days. Its incidence is approximately 1 per 1,000 / 2,000 births. It is considered the most common congenital anomaly of the central nervous system that is compatible with life, 90% of the defects are lumbar and sacral.

1. The most frequent form is myelomeningocele (MMC), characterized by the extrusion of the spinal cord into a sac filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and is associated with lower limb paralysis and bowel and bladder neurological dysfunction.
2. The majority of MMCs can be diagnosed between before 20 weeks. MMC is associated with Chiari II malformation, which includes a constellation of anomalies such as hindbrain herniation, brainstem abnormalities, low-lying venous sinuses and a small posterior fossa.The Chiari II malformation can have deleterious effects on motor, cranial nerve and cognitive functions. Postnatally most MMC patients develop hydrocephalus and require a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Shunts require lifelong monitoring and have a high failure rate due to infection, obstruction, and fracture.

Experimental studies using animal models have shown that prenatal coverage of a spina bifida-like lesion can preserve neurological function and reduce or reverse hindbrain herniation.These studies suggest a ""two-hit"" hypothesis in which the ultimate neurologic deficit results from a combination of the failure of normal neural-tube closure (first hit) with secondary spinal cord injury resulting from prolonged exposure of sensitive neural elements to the amniotic fluid (second hit mechanism).

Based on this hypothesis, open fetal surgical repair of MMC was proposed, and the recent publication of the NICHD sponsored randomized controlled trial demonstrated clear neonatal benefit of open in-utero fetal surgical repair of MMC. The study showed a reduction in the incidence of hydrocephalus and in the radiographic severity of hindbrain herniation (relative risk: 0.67; 95% confidence interval: 0.56-0.81).

Open in-utero fetal surgery is not without risk and the NICHD study (MOMS Trial) showed an elevation in maternal-fetal morbidity/risk when compared to the postnatally treated group, including higher risk for chorioamniotic separation (26% vs. 0%, respectively), maternal pulmonary edema (6% vs. 0%), oligohydramnios (21% vs. 0%), placental abruption (6% vs. 0%), spontaneous membrane rupture (46%; RR: 6.15; 95% CI: 2.75-13.78), spontaneous labor (38%; RR: 2.80, 95%CI: 1.51-5.18), maternal blood transfusion (9%; RR: 7.18; 95%CI: 0.90-57.01), and preterm delivery before 34 weeks (46%; RR: 9.2; 95%CI: 3.81-22.19). The reason for the increased incidence of these complications is related to the nature of the open fetal procedure, which involves a multi-faceted invasive approach including maternal laparotomy, large hysterotomy with uterine edge stapling, and open fetal repair of the spina bifida defect that may involve manipulation and exposure of the fetus for a significant amount of time.

Fetal endoscopic surgery has progressed rapidly over the past decades and the investigators are now able to perform a number of intricate procedures inside the uterus with specially designed instruments. These procedures include laser therapy for Twin-twin-transfusion syndrome, fetal cystoscopy and fulguration of posterior urethral valves, release of amniotic bands, and placement of various shunts and balloons inside fetal structures and cavities (peritoneal, pleural, cardiac, and trachea).

Fetoscopy offers a less invasive therapeutic option that could reduce a number of the morbidities (both maternal and fetal) related to open fetal procedures.

A few animal studies and some clinical human experience with fetoscopic repair of MMC have been reported showing the feasibility of covering the defect with a patch and sealant, or even in performing a full repair. These repairs have been accomplished using at least two (and sometimes more) entry ports through the uterine wall. Kohl et al. in Germany, have demonstrated the feasibility of performing a complete percutaneous fetoscopic repair of MMC using carbon dioxide to distend the uterus and provide a dry working area for the surgeon to perform the repair.

These investigators described a two-layer covering technique using an absorbable patch (Durasis, Cook, Germany) and sutures. However, while they showed that the procedure is feasible, their percutaneous technique with complete two layer surgical closure of the defect using sutures was associated with prolonged operative time and significant maternal and obstetrical morbidities.

Fetoscopy in a CO2 gas filled uterus has been recently reported by groups in Bonn, Germany (Kohl et al) and Sao Paulo, Brazil (Pedreira et al). The fetoscopic technique the investigators use has been developed and tested in a fetal sheep model of MMC by the investigators group and others (Peiro et al). This fetoscopy technique has now been employed by a group of investigators, in human fetal surgery cases in Houston, Texas, Monterrey México and in Shiraz, Iran showing its feasibility and applicability to the human uterus and fetus, and demonstrating an improved degree of flexibility in terms of access to the fetus regardless of placental location. The technique is designed to decrease the maternal risks of open uterus fetal surgery while maintaining a similar level of fetal benefit as seen in the MOMS trial.

The investigators technique employs general deep anesthesia and an open abdomen/exteriorized (but closed) uterus methodology that allows the minimally invasive closure of the fetal neural tube using the same closed skin repair currently employed at another US centers using the open uterus approach. The technique employs a novel approach to low pressure uterine distention using the same carbon dioxide gas 8-12 mmHg that others attempting fetoscopic repair have used, but employing a much lower gas flow rate and pressure. In addition, this technique allows a significantly quicker neural tube repair because of improved access to the fetus, ability to manipulate the fetus into the required position, and superior port placement resulting from the exteriorized maternal uterus.

The technique consist in a three access ports (10 French each) and these can be sutured into the uterus allowing a closed seal and minimizing gas leakage. Finally, a 2-3 mm Storz surgical sets enables a full surgical repair to be performed via a fetoscopic approach.

There have been reports about sheep model, with dual access port fetoscopic neural tube closure using a 12 french cannula, a second 9 french cannula, a cover patch, and a medical sealant with similar results to that seen with open fetal surgical repair in the same sheep model. Using the knowledge and expertise gained with more than 3 years of experience in fetoscopic sheep surgery, Dr. Peiro has now performed 8 minimally invasive repairs on human patients in Barcelona (Vall D'Hebron Hospital, Instituto Nacional de Perinatologia, Mexico City, Mexico). Also there have been reports at Texas Childrens Hospital ( Belfort) using two ports technique in order to successfully repair the defect.

The neurosurgical repair proposed in this protocol will involves release of the placode, dissection of the surrounding skin and attempted primary closure of the defect using available skin. In those cases where the investigators are able to complete the procedure with full skin closure of the defect, the only difference between the open uterus procedure and the fetoscopic procedure, will be that the surgery will be done fetoscopically rather than through an open uterine incision. If the investigator group is unable to close the skin primarily despite best fetoscopic efforts, the option of performing/completing the repair as an open procedure exists and will be offered to the patient previous counselling of the maternal morbidity. The patient is monitored in hospital until ready for discharge.

Approximately 6 weeks after the surgery a post-procedure fetal MRI will be performed. If there is evidence of good closure of the neural tube defect and reversal of the Chiari II malformation, a vaginal delivery can be attempted based on obstetric criteria. Patients will be followed in person every 3-4 months after birth to 12 months at the Spina Bifida Clinic at Christus Muguerza Alta Especialidad. Remaining visits will be yearly up to 5 years. If this is not possible, questionnaire(s) will be mailed to the participants and records will be requested from the treating neurosurgeon on this same schedule.","Medicina Perinatal Alta Especialidad, México",OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,45.0,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,Intervention model: single group assignment Masking: None (Open label) Primary purpose: treatment,TREATMENT,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Conditioning and maintenance regimens carry a risk of both short- and long-term cardiotoxicity, leading to serious cardiovascular events including acute coronary syndrome (ACS), cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension, and pericardial effusion. The pathophysiology of cardiotoxicity in HSCT patients remains poorly understood.

It is therefore crucial to investigate underlying mechanisms and identify predictive factors of cardiotoxicity in order to provide appropriate cardiological follow-up and management. Current European Society of Cardiology guidelines recommend routine monitoring of HSCT patients with echocardiography and cardiac biomarkers (NT-proBNP, troponin), although these recommendations are based on small-scale studies. The cardiodepressor factor DPP3 has shown promising results in cardio-oncology, with a causal role in anthracycline-induced cardiac dysfunction. Its role in HSCT-related cardiotoxicity requires further evaluation.

This multicenter study of HSCT recipients will be a valuable resource, enabling a better understanding of the pathophysiology of cardiotoxicity and prognosis.

It is the leading cause of disability in the world. The factors that lead to chronicity of low back pain are multi-factorial and are essentially represented by psychosocial factors (catastrophism, kinesiophobia, algophobia job dissatisfaction, emotional problems such as depression, anxiety, stress, injustice, etc.).

Pain is a multimodal experience that involves different brain structures that are activated by the pain signal and involve the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The vagus nerve is the main actor of one of the two branches of the ANS, the parasympathetic system, which acts as a ""slow-down"".

The vagus nerve participates in the inter-neuronal transmission of key neurotransmitters for mood, alertness, attention and motivation.

Vagal stimulation has been used for many years as an analgesic device in chronic pain (vascular pain (facial vascular pain, fibromyalgia, visceral pain, gastrointestinal and pelvic pain...)

To date, no study has been conducted on the value of vagal stimulation in chronic low back pain.","Low back pain is a major public health problem. It is the leading cause of disability in the world.

The factors that lead to chronicity of low back pain are multifactorial, which explains the modest effectiveness of both drug treatments and multidisciplinary programs (analgesic drug interventions, non-pharmacological interventions with rehabilitation, physical exercise, psychotherapy, spinal ergonomics, meditation, yoga, etc.) in the treatment of low back pain. psychotherapy, spinal ergonomics, meditation, yoga...) in chronic forms. These factors of chronicization are essentially represented by psychosocial factors (catastrophism, kinesiophobia, algophobia, job dissatisfaction, emotional problems such as depression, anxiety stress, injustice...)

In the chronic low back pain population, pain is a multimodal experience that involves different brain structures (insula, anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala and prefrontal cortex). These structures are activated by the pain signal and involve the autonomic nervous system (ANS).

The vagus nerve is the main actor of one of the two branches of the ANS, the parasympathetic system, which acts as a ""slow-down"".

The vagus nerve is involved in the inter-neuronal transmission of key neurotransmitters for mood, alertness, attention and motivation (serotonin, dopamine, oxytocin and noradrenaline).

It is one of the longest nerves in the human body, originating from the base of the brain (nucleus tractus solitarius) and innervating most of the organs (heart, lung, stomach, liver, spleen, kidneys, gallbladder, pancreas, intestines). It allows the integration of information from the periphery (pain, stress, emotions), slows down the heart rate after a stress, reduces the caliber of the bronchial tubes to help breathing, reduces the inflammatory response, participates in digestion and in the communication with the digestive microbiota.

Indeed, there seems to be an alteration of the vagal function in chronic pain patients patients: the vagus nerve is involved in the modulation of pain at different levels (medullary, cerebral) (medullary, cerebral) but also on the different components of pain (sensory, affective emotional, behavioral).

The benefit of the stimulation of the vagus would be mediated by a modulation of afferent information (stress, pain, emotion) associated with a benefit of ""relaxation"" conveyed by the efferent fibers (cardiac, pulmonary effect...).

This stimulation of the vagus nerve is done through an atrial electrode that stimulates the atrial branch of the vagus nerve.

To date, no study has been conducted on the value of vagal stimulation in chronic low back pain.

Because of the multifactorial mechanisms involved in this pathology, this type of therapy appears to be a useful complement to the management of our patients.

This pilot study will allow us to evaluate the feasibility of a larger study with a placebo arm.

Neck dissection is surgery to remove lymph nodes and other tissues in the neck. It is not yet known whether a neck dissection should always be performed in treating patients with head and neck cancer.

PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying PET/CT scan-guided watchful waiting compared with neck dissection of locally advanced lymph node metastases in treating patients who are undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy for primary head and neck cancer.","OBJECTIVES:

* To compare the efficacy, in terms of overall survival, disease-specific survival, recurrence, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness, of a PET/CT scan-guided watch and wait policy with the current practice of planned neck dissection in the management of advanced (N2 or N3) nodal metastases in patients with primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma undergoing chemoradiotherapy.
* To assess the predictive value of PET/CT scanning in detecting persistent or residual disease in the primary site.

OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to center, chemotherapy schedule (concurrent platinum vs concurrent cetuximab vs neoadjuvant and concurrent platinum vs neoadjuvant docetaxel, platinum, and fluorouracil with concurrent platinum), T stage (T1-T2 vs T3-T4), and N stage (N2a-N2b vs N2c-N3). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

* Arm I: Patients receive standard concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Patients undergo PET/CT scan at 9-13 weeks after completion of CRT. Patients with complete response of primary site undergo neck dissection within 4 weeks.
* Arm II: Patients undergo neck dissection and then receive standard CRT. Patients undergo PET/CT scan at 9-13 weeks after completion of CRT.

Patients are assessed periodically for quality-of-life. Tissue and blood samples collected periodically are stored for future research.

The investigators wanted to find out how the participants experienced their health, workability and work capacity, quality of life, diet and self-efficacy before and during the intervention","The background for this study was insights about obesity and sick leave. Obesity is related to lower labor force participation, increased sickness absence and reduced productivity. A Danish study from 2006 reported a yearly 1, 8 million extra days of work absence and close to 1.100 cases of disability pension related to obesity. A 2016-report from OECD show that persons with obesity between the ages 50-59 have three times as much work absence as those who do not struggle with obesity. This indicates that persons with obesity are a group where the need for work rehabilitation is important.

Although this strategy effectively reduces the risk of local recurrence, it fails to effectively improve the overall survival rate of patients . The root cause is that 5-fluorouracil/capecitabine based local radiotherapy is not effective in controlling potential micrometastases. Therefore, many studies try to combine preoperative radiotherapy with more intense chemotherapy and targeted drugs at the same time, as well as induction chemotherapy before preoperative radiotherapy and consolidation chemotherapy after, in order to obtain better efficacy. However, a number of studies have shown that increasing cytotoxic drugs fail to effectively improve pathologic complete response rate (pCR) and long-term survival rate, and significantly increase therapeutic toxicity . Therefore, the idea of trying to increase the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs by accumulating them does not work.Based on the use of PD-1/PD-L1 antibody in colorectal cancer and other solid tumors, and referring to the scheme of PD-1/PD-L1 antibody combined with radiotherapy in other solid tumors, we added envafolimab to local radiotherapy for advanced rectal cancer for exploration, with a view to further improving the pCR rate and long-term survival of patients.","Inclusion criteria：

db0318374e6d4bad,NCT06732570,Effect of High Intensity Laser on Shoulder Impingement.,Effect of High Intensity Laser on Shoulder Impingement Syndrome in Adolescents,lasershoulder,high power laser for shoulder,"Treatment for shoulder impingement is conservative initially, Rehabilitation programs generally consist of exercise therapy and manual therapy that provide relief from symptoms of impingement. High-intensity laser therapy used recently and was found to be effective in the short term in the treatment of pain and disability in patients with impingement.

This study aims to

* Investigate the effect of high intensity power laser therapy on sonographic measurement in the adolescent suffering from shoulder impingement syndrome.
* Investigate the effect of high intensity power laser therapy on pain in the adolescent suffering from shoulder impingement syndrome.
* Investigate the effect of high intensity power laser therapy on shoulder function in the adolescent suffering from shoulder impingement syndrome.

RESEARCH QUESTION:

Does using high intensity power laser affects shoulder dysfunction in adolescent with shoulder impingement syndrome?","Shoulder symptoms are often persistent and recurrent and represents approximately one fifth of all musculoskeletal disability payment. One of the most common causes of shoulder pain is the occurrence of tendinopathy resulting from the impingement of rotator cuff tendons under the coracoacromial arch which refer to impingement syndrome.

Treatment for shoulder impingement is conservative initially, Rehabilitation programs generally consist of exercise therapy that provide relief from symptoms of impingement, Exercise therapy has been shown to be effective in the reducing pain and improving function also it was stated that the exercise therapy lead to improving shoulder musculoskeletal risk factors in competitive athletes with Specific exercise was superior to non-specific exercise. Strong recommendation may be made to include manual therapy as an adjunct intervention with exercise.

The manual therapy technique of joint mobilizations which are commonly used by physiotherapists for reducing pain and disability in patients with shoulder musculoskeletal disorders, Manual therapy which involves realigning collagen, enhancing fiber slip, reducing adhesion, and re-establishing correct gleno-humeral joint kinematics, can relieve pain by stimulating peripheral mechanical receptors, suppressing nociceptors, boosting synovial fluid nutrition, and reducing adhesion. It has been stated that impingement patients treated with manual therapy in combination with supervised exercise showed improvement in pain and function.

High-intensity laser therapy (HILT) is a treatment method that added to therapeutic interventions recently. HILT improves the microcirculation and tissue regeneration with photomechanic effects in deep tissues. Biostimulation, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties contribute to an effective improvement in painful bone-muscle-joint pathologies, including shoulder problems. Adding therapeutic interventions to laser therapy is usual in clinical practice. HILT was found to be effective in the short term in the treatment of pain and disability in patients with Sub-acromial pain syndrome.

Ultrasonography is recommended as the first line imaging tool to evaluate sports injuries; it has been used as the preferred technique for evaluating the subacromial space.

Algometers are devices that can be used to identify the pressure and/or force eliciting a pressure-pain threshold. . This technique is a well-known and well-validated method to induce acute experimental pain.

Null Hypothesis:

High intensity laser therapy will not affect the sonographic measurement in adolescents with shoulder impingement syndrome.

High intensity laser therapy will not affect the pain in adolescents with shoulder impingement syndrome.

High intensity power laser therapy will not affect the shoulder function in adolescents suffering from shoulder impingement syndrome.

It will be assumed that:

* All evaluation and treatment procedures will be performed in the same environment for all patients
* All volunteers will attend the treatment program regularly.
* All volunteers will be cooperative, following the instructions given to them, and exert their maximum effort during the study.

In the presence of an empty marrow, pancytopenia, and transfusion dependence, the severity of the disease is based on neutrophil (PMN) count: nonsevere AA (nSAA; PMN \> 0.5 × 109/L), severe AA (SAA;PMN 0.2- 0.5 × 109/L), and very severe AA (vSAA; PMN\< 0.2 × 109/L).

Allogeneic BMT from an HLA-identical sibling donor or matched-alternative donor is the treatment of choice for patients with aplastic anaemia.Transplantation for patients with severe aplastic anaemia from an HLA identical sibling donor is now very successful with a 75-90% chance of long term cure and with overall survival of between 65% and 73% at 5 years for matched-alternative donor transplantation. However, these two approachs are limited by the availability of HLA-matched donors.

Patients without HLA-identical sibling donor or matched-alternative donor can be offered immunosuppressive treatment (IST) involving injections of Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) in combination with cyclosporine (CsA). The treatment response with ATG is at best between 60-80%, 30%-40% patients relapse following an initial response to treatment. Moreover, a recent study has shown that on multivariate analysis of response at 6 months, only younger age, absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), correlate with response to ATG. Patients with SAA or vSAA, with much lower ARC and ALC, were poor response to IST and have high risks of dying of infection and bleeding.

Nowadays, with advances in transplant technology, HLA-mismatched related donors and unrelated donors transplantation has achieved good clinical results. Data from the XJ Huang indicated that patients with HLA-mismatched related donors achieved 100% donor myeloid engraftment and have a survival rate of 64.6±12.4%. Retrospectively analyzed results for 154 patients with acquired SAA who received BMT from unrelated donors identified through the Japan Marrow Donor Program showed the probability of OS at 5 years was 56% (95% confidence interval, 34%-78%).

Compared with malignant disease, mismatched related donor or unrelated donor HSCT for SAA involves distinct challenges mainly associated with high graft failure and high GVHD. So, if we can find a way to promote implantation meanwhile prevent or reduce GVHD , the efficacy of HLA-mismatched related donors transplantation can improve.

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multi-potent non-hematopoietic progenitors mainly found in BM, cord blood, and adipose tissue. MSCs are attractive because of the ease with which they can be isolated and expanded ex vivo, their ability to undergo multilineage differentiation, and their lack of immunogenicity. These cells were shown to provide support for the growth and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in BM micro-environments. In additon, preliminary studies have shown clinical effectiveness of allogeneic MSC in the treatment of refractory graft-versus-host disease and an improvement in or resolution of severe aGVHD when co-transplantation with MSCs. Due to these properties, MSCs have become an interesting candidate for use in cellular therapy and are considered ""theoretically perfect cells"" for potential clinical use against AA mismatched related donors transplantation.",Guangzhou General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,100.0,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,,TREATMENT,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

The exploratory objectives are to compare the occurrence of MACE-4; MACE-5; MACE-3; all-cause death; cardiovascular death; myocardial infarction; stroke; coronary revascularization and hospitalization for unstable angina between 2 cohorts with or without grafts/vein grafts failure at 1 year angiographic follow-up.","This is a non-interventional, observational study designed to compare clinical outcomes 5 years after CABG in subjects enrolled in DACAB trial.

After completing 12-month randomized treatment from DACAB trial, investigators would not make any interventions or impact on subjects'therapeutic strategy. Aspirin monotherapy would be given to most subjects according to the current guidelines. However, other antiplatelet regimens might be given for subjects by their attending physician based on the subject's individual condition. Subjects would spontaneously undergo regular laboratory test , electrocardiogram (ECG), ultrasound cardiography (UCG), coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) or coronary angiography (CAG) and clinical follow-up according to clinical need and their individual condition.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* whether giving tablets to people at high risks of clots after a leg injury is as good as injections (standard care)
* whether giving any medication after a leg injury is better than standard care (advice only) for people at low risk of clots.

Participants will be assessed to be high risk (TiLLI High) or low risk (TiLLI Low). People who are at high risk of clots will have either tablets or injections to reduce their risk. People at low risk will receive tablets, injections or no medication.

Drug treatments will be provided for the duration of immobilisation or up to 42 days (whichever is earlier), in accordance with current NICE guidelines. The participants will be followed up for 90 days following randomisation.","People have an increased risk of blood clots when they have a leg injury treated with a plaster cast or a splint, which happens to over 70,000 people every year in the UK. Blood clots can cause long term problems in the legs and can also move to the lungs, causing serious illness and occasionally death. Medicines are available to reduce the risk of blood clots, but they can also increase the risk of bleeding. In people at high risk of clots, most hospitals use the recommended daily injections which can be uncomfortable and sometimes difficult to give. Tablets are available that reduce the risk of blood clots in other groups, but it is not known if tablets work as well as the injections for people with a leg injury. It is also not known whether people at low risk of blood clots may benefit from any medication. As such, a national research body has identified the need for further study on this topic.

The TiLLI study has two aims - to determine whether giving tablets to people at high risk of clots after a leg injury is as good as injections, and whether giving any medication is better than standard care (advice only) for people at low risk of clots.

The TiLLI study consists of two linked trials: TiLLI-High and TiLLI-Low. People who have been placed in a plaster cast or splint after a leg injury will be invited to participate. Those who agree and are at high risk of clots will enter TiLLI-High and be randomised to receive either tablets or injections to reduce their risk of blood clots; those at low risk will enter TiLLI-Low and will be randomised to receive tablets, injections, or no medication. Patients and doctors will know what medication they are taking. All patients will be provided with written guidance on the signs and symptoms of blood clots and advice on managing their medication.

Information will be collected from study participants up to 90 days after joining the study to find out whether anyone suffers blood clots or complications from the medication. This data will be collected by reviewing medical records and contacting participants as needed. To encourage people from different backgrounds to take part, the study will run from lots of different hospitals across the UK. Study materials will be translated into different languages for those who do not speak English. The investigators will collect as much information as possible from people without extra hospital visits. An independent panel will look at the data as the study progresses to decide whether it is safe to continue.

The study will cost approximately £300 per patient, which is excellent value for money. If these trials show that tablets are as effective as injections, approximately 20,000 patients will be able to avoid injections and \>£1.5 million will be released back to NHS resources, every year.

The investigators propose to test a novel, low-cost, intensive and individually tailored intervention that combines virtual reality (VR) and field training to enhance community ambulation and participation in stroke survivors discharged from rehabilitation.

The aims are to: (1) Assess feasibility, acceptability, safety and adherence of the intervention in stroke survivors; and (2) Examine the extent to which post-intervention changes in functional walking and participation to community walking vary according to walking, cognitive and visual-perceptual abilities.

The investigators will use a virtual environment prototype simulating a shopping mall and surrounding streets, in which participants will interact using VR goggles and game controllers. Scenarios of increasing levels of complexity will be introduced. This intervention study involves a single group, multiple pre- multiple post- study design where chronic stroke participants will engage in a 4-week training program. The program will include VR training sessions performed in the clinical setting (3/week) and practice of community ambulation skills while supervised by family/caregivers (2/week). Participants will be assessed on measures of functional walking, balance \& mobility and participation to community walking. Adherence, safety and acceptability will be documented. This study will generate foundation knowledge on the response to the intervention based on individual capacities.","Ambulating in community environments requires the skills to cope with multiple, simultaneous dimensions such as walking speed and distance, etc. Such skills remain compromised in the majority of stroke survivors due to insufficient or lack of targeted practice. The investigators propose to test a new, individually-tailored intervention, developed by the research team, grounded in best evidence in community ambulation, principles of motor learning and participatory action research. This unique intervention will combine virtual reality (VR) and field training practice to optimize learning that can be generalized to daily walking activities.

Participants will engage in the 4-week, individually-tailored intervention that comprises of supervised VR training sessions (3 times/week) performed in the clinical setting. VR sessions will be completed by field training assignments. Subjects will be assessed twice prior to the intervention, immediately after the intervention and at follow up.

Generalized estimating equations will be used to compare changes in main and secondary outcomes across time points, with each personal factor of interest (e.g. walking capacity, visual-perceptual function, and cognitive function) analyzed individually while adjusting for age. Outcomes on adherence, safety and acceptability will be analyzed with descriptive statistics.

Required sample size was estimated based on Green's rule (effect size=0.5, power=80%, α=0.05) with a variance inflation factor assuming moderate within-subject correlations for 3 post-baseline measurement time points. This yields a sample size of 30.

To study if participation in a rehabilitation exercise program can help people recovering from COVID-19.

Eligibility:

Adults ages 18-80 with a lab-confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection (the virus that causes COVID-19), and are still having some symptoms.

Design:

Participants will have a medical history and physical exam. They will give blood and urine samples. They will have tests to measure heart and lung function. Their blood vessels will be assessed.

Participants will have a computed tomography scan of the body. They will have an ultrasound of the muscles in their arms, legs, and chest.

Participants will take a 6-minute walk test. They will take other balance and movement tests.

Participants will walk on a treadmill while hooked up to a monitor. Then they will be interviewed. It will be audio-recorded.

Participants will complete surveys about their symptoms and daily activities.

Participants will take a smell test. For this, they will identify different smells. They will also have memory, attention, and mental functioning tests.

Participants will wear an activity monitor on their wrist 24 hours a day. They will exercise 3 times a week for 10 weeks by moving vigorously on a track or treadmill for 30 minutes. They will attend education classes once a week for 10 weeks.

Participants will be contacted by phone or email every 3 months for 1 year after they complete the exercise part of the study. They will wear an activity monitor for up to 2 weeks.","Study Description:

This randomized controlled trial will determine whether aerobic exercise training has a beneficial effect on physical function, health-related quality of life, free-living physical activity and sleep quality among survivors of COVID-19. Participants will be randomized to either an aerobic exercise training and education (AET+) group or a control education only group (CON) for 10 weeks. Assessments for physical function, self-reported health outcomes for quality of life (QOL), free-living physical activity and sleep quality will be measured at baseline and following the 10-week intervention period. Participants in the CON group will then crossover and perform AET after the 10-week follow-up visit. All participants will be monitored for one year to capture free-living physical activity, sleep quality and health-related QOL outcomes over time. It is hypothesized that following 10 weeks, physical function, health-related QOL, free-living physical activity and sleep quality will show greater improvement with AET+.

Objectives:

Primary Objective:

To examine the effect of aerobic exercise training on physical function in participants recovering from COVID-19.

Secondary Objectives:

To examine the effect of aerobic exercise training on patient reported outcomes and other health-related QOL components in participants recovering from COVID-19; To examine the effect of aerobic exercise training on free-living physical activity and sleep quality in participants recovering from COVID-19.

Exploratory Objectives:

To explore the effect of aerobic exercise training on clinical outcomes, cardiorespiratory function, cognition, biomarkers, metabolomics, ultrasound-based muscle measurements, and vascular function in participants recovering from COVID-19; To explore the feasibility of conducting the AET program remotely in the crossover CON group of participants recovering from COVID-19; To explore follow-up physical activity, sleep quality and health-related QOL outcomes over 1 year in participants recovering from COVID-19.

c47327b0833cf753,NCT03954769,"A Pilot Study of ""Stanford Proxy Test for Delirium"" (S-PTD)","A Pilot Study of the Psychometric Properties of the ""Stanford Proxy Test for Delirium"" (S-PTD): a New Screening Tool for the Detection of Delirium",,28327,"Although there are several tools available for the screening of delirium among the medically ill, they all have some limitations. First, none of the available tools have been validated against newly developed and published DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual) or ICD-10 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems) criteria. Additionally, all the screening/diagnostic tools presently available have the same limitation, they all require significant patient involvement and participation (e.g., questions and activities) in order to complete the assessment. By definition, delirium is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by disturbance in attention and awareness, and additional disturbance in cognition (e.g., memory deficit, disorientation), language, visuospatial ability, or perception. The intrinsic characteristics of delirium seem to interfere with the patient's ability to participate and complete many of the tasks associated with delirium evaluation itself. Finally, most available tools seem to narrowly focus on some neurocognitive areas of delirium, but not being comprehensive enough.

In contrast, the S-PTD is designed so it can be completed by the nursing staff caring for the patients, the medical personnel most intimately involved with the care and aware of the behaviors exhibited by the patient during the course of their hospital stay. The idea is that nurses will complete the screening tool (hence the term ""by proxy""), based on the behaviors and interactions observed during the course of a conventional ""nursing shift"", to determine whether the patient meets current neuropsychiatric criteria for the diagnosis of delirium.","Patients admitted to Stanford Hospital and Clinics medical and surgical units meeting the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria will be considered for enrollment during the recruitment phase.

The research personnel, under the supervision of the study PI (an expert in delirium), will perform daily study procedures as follows:

A member of the research team will obtain a list of all newly admitted patients from the prior 24 hours each Monday through Friday morning from the unit's nurse manager. A member of the research team will also look at daily operating room schedules for patients to be admitted to participating units post-operatively, having received permission to do so from the directors of participating medical/surgical services. Given that the purpose of this tool is to screen for a condition that may occur in medically ill patients, every newly admitted patient or their surrogate (for those lacking decisional making capacity), meeting inclusion criteria will be approached for participation in the study and asked to provide consent. Patients lacking capacity for consent will not be automatically excluded, given that the inclusion of delirious patients is critical for adequate evaluation of the S-PTD, and most delirious patients, by definition, lack capacity to provide informed consent. We will ask for the consent from surrogate decision makers in these cases.

In addition, it is anticipated that some patients who meet eligibility will be unable to sign a consent form due to physical limitations related to their hospitalization (e.g. patients recovering from recent surgery). If a patient is unable to sign the consent form due to physical limitations, oral consent will be obtained. Oral consent will also be used in the event that a patient lacks capacity and has no surrogate decision-maker at bedside, but a surrogate decision-maker is available by phone. For Spanish-speaking patients, consent will be obtained by the same procedures utilizing Spanish-language written/oral consent, with the help of SHC interpreter services.

For each patient that consents to participate in the study, the nurse assigned to that patient during the shift will be approached. These nurses will additionally be asked to provide consent, as they are also subjects of the study.

All patients will be followed for the duration of their hospital stay (expected to average 5 days), to a maximum of two weeks, except in the case of delirious patients, who will be followed until the resolution of the episode of delirium.

Every day, enrolled patients will undergo two, separate evaluations. Towards the end of their shift (within the last 2-hrs of each shift) the patient's nurse will complete the S-PTD, utilizing all available data from the entire nursing shift (8-12 hours, depending the unit's shift mode), which allows nurses to take into account all of nurse's interactions and observations across the entire shift (including direct interactions between the patient and the nurse, family and all clinical staff). In addition, patients will undergo a clinical neuropsychiatric examination performed by a neuropsychiatrist (the gold standard), estimated to take about 5 minutes. The examiners will be blind to the results of each other's exam. Finally, a member of the research team, blind to the results of the previous tests, will conduct a separate interview of the patient's nurse towards the end of the shift in order collect the nurse's forms and evaluate the nurse's opinions regarding the ease to complete the S-PTD.

Later the results of the S-PTD will be compared against the results of the neuropsychiatric examination. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the S-PTD will be calculated as compared to the results of clinical neuropsychiatric evaluation based on DSM-5 criteria.",Stanford University,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,OBSERVATIONAL,False,ACTUAL,300.0,,,,,CASE_ONLY,PROSPECTIVE,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

This treatment is usually preceded by pelvic lymphadenectomy to assess the possible extension to lymph nodes of prostatic cancer and to avoid irradiating the pelvis in case of no lymph node involvement. However, radiotherapy leads usually to about 30% of grade ≥2 risk of bladder and/or rectal toxicity. This risk particularly depends on the radiation volume. In the aim of lowering the toxicity, the treatment in this study will associate:

* pelvic lymph node dissection and resection of seminal vesicles, allowing decreasing the radiation target volume to the prostate only (and not to irradiate the SV);
* a high-precision radiotherapy technique combining Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) and Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT).","This study targets non metastatic prostatic locally-advanced adenocarcinomas which are at high risk of both local progression and metastases. The standard treatment of these tumours associates external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and 3 years of androgen deprivation (AD) with LH-RH analogue. In the absence of AD and mainly when prostate specific antigen (PSA) is \>10 ng/ml, several randomized studies have shown that high doses of EBRT increase biochemical control. Nevertheless, escalating the doses of radiation significantly increases the risk of rectal and/or urinary toxicities. In order to lower the toxicity of irradiation in locally-advanced prostate cancers, and to improve the quality of life of patients, this study aims at decreasing the volume of irradiated healthy tissues. To carry out this objective, we will use a double strategy:

* Limiting the target volume to prostate only by removing seminal vesicles at the time of lymph node dissection,
* Using a technique of high-precision radiation combining Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) and Image-Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT).

Based on the literature, we may assume a toxicity rate of 30% during the three years of hormonotherapy with standard treatment (i.e. without removing seminal vesicles).

In Phase 1, all study schools will be randomly assigned to a 50K4Life only, or 50K4Life + SMS Text Messaging group.

In Phase 2, non-responder schools will be randomly assigned to one of two 6-month adaptive treatments: a) an individual-level intervention that includes remote education modules (REM) and one-to-one monthly phone-based coaching, or, b) a school-level intervention that includes group educational sessions, school environmental modifications (floor distance markings, signage in corridors and breakrooms, promotional items), and work time/weekend group walks/hikes. The schools that 50% or more participants who achieve 50,000 steps in one week will continue with the Phase 1 condition. Intervention strategies will be coordinated by health educators and managed using the Pathverse app. Data collection will occur at baseline, 8 weeks (Phase 2 randomization decision point), 8 months (immediate post intervention), 12 months (4 months post-intervention), and 18 months (10 months post-intervention) for a total of 18 months of study participation.","Mexican Americans who live in the U.S.-Mexico border region suffer disproportionately from preventable cardiometabolic diseases. Regular brisk walking is an effective measure in regulating metabolic processes and preventing disease. Employer-based wellness programs are promising strategies to address this public health problem because of the opportunity to take advantage of workplace environments to improve opportunities for walking engagement while also addressing barriers associated with inactivity. Employer-based walking programs have not been widely tested on the U.S.-Mexico border. A clustered Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) will be conducted to determine the effectiveness of an employer-based walking challenge intervention- 50,000 for Life (50K4Life)- in improving brisk walking engagement (at least 7,000 steps/day) among school district employees. The proposed intervention strategies are based on the walking interventions conducted by the Principal Investigator(s) in El Paso and behavioral, environmental and worksite interventions by the Co-Investigators. The trial will include 30 randomly selected public schools with predominantly Mexican American employees from El Paso County area school districts.

However, approximately 10-30% of patients do not respond to initial therapy and up to 50% lose response over time. Variability in response to therapy may be influenced by multiple interacting factors at different levels. Recent studies showed that measurement of serum infliximab concentrations during induction therapy predicts treatment effects at one year. Therefore, therapeutic monitoring of infliximab is proposed as a useful strategy to improve clinical outcomes and optimize healthcare resources.

Most commercially available methods for infliximab quantification are based on the ELISA assay, which has an assay time of at least 8 hours. Recently, commercial point-of-care devices became available with assay times of less than one hour, enabling real-time therapeutic drug monitoring; however, validation of these devices in clinical settings and comparison with standard assays are still needed, particularly in pediatric patients. In addition, some studies suggest that loss of response in patients treated with anti-TNFs may be partly due to the emergence of specific anti-drug antibodies (AAFs). A limitation of the most widely used ELISA assays is the inability to quantify drug and AAF when they are simultaneously present. Recently, innovative ELISA assays have become available to overcome this problem. However, there is a lack of comparative studies between the classical and the specific method in terms of clinical response in pediatric patients. In patients who do not respond to infliximab, especially if they have high levels of AAF, guidelines call for the use of adalimumab. For this drug, the evidence in the literature regarding therapeutic monitoring of adalimumab concentrations and association with response in pediatric patients is still very preliminary. This study, carried out in in pediatric patients with IBD, aims to:

1. validate the ""point of care"" infliximab assay by comparing it with reference ELISA assays;
2. evaluate the correlation of infliximab and AAF levels, as measured by the innovative ELISA assays, with response to therapy, compared to traditional assays.
3. evaluate the association between adalimumab and AAF levels and response to therapy","Anti-TNF agents, particularly infliximab and adalimumab, changed the way chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refractory to conventional therapies is treated, including in pediatric patients. These biologic agents also appear promising as first-line treatment even in the early stages of the disease. However, approximately 10-30% of patients do not respond to initial therapy and up to 50% lose response over time. In addition, the widespread use of these drugs is limited by serious side effects and the high cost of therapy. Variability in response to therapy may be influenced by multiple interacting factors at different levels. Recent studies showed that measurement of serum infliximab concentrations during induction therapy predicts treatment effects at one year: in particular, patients with infliximab concentrations below 3 ug/ml at the end of induction (pre-dose IV infusion) have a reduced probability of response. Therefore, therapeutic monitoring of infliximab is proposed as a useful strategy to improve clinical outcomes and optimize healthcare resources.

Currently, most commercially available methods for infliximab quantification are based on the ELISA assay, which has an assay time of at least 8 hours, delaying therapeutic adjustment to the next drug infusion. Recently, commercial point-of-care devices became available with assay times of less than one hour, enabling real-time therapeutic drug monitoring; however, validation of these devices in clinical settings and comparison with standard assays are still needed, particularly in pediatric patients. In addition, some studies suggest that loss of response in patients treated with anti-TNFs, infliximab and adalimumab, may be partly due to the emergence of specific anti-drug antibodies (AAFs). A limitation of the most widely used ELISA assays is the inability to quantify drug and AAF when they are simultaneously present. Data from the literature suggest that in patients who lose response to anti-TNFs, classical ELISA assays may overestimate the percentage of patients with low levels of both drug and AAF; the use of specific ELISA assays allows accurate quantification of drug and AAF levels even in these patients, allowing the clinician to modify therapy accordingly. Recently, innovative ELISA assays have become available to overcome this problem. However, there is a lack of comparative studies between the classical and the specific method in terms of clinical response in pediatric patients. In patients who do not respond to infliximab, especially if they have high levels of AAF, guidelines call for the use of adalimumab. For this drug, the evidence in the literature regarding therapeutic monitoring of adalimumab concentrations and association with response in pediatric patients is still very preliminary. Thus, the research objectives are three, of equal importance:

1. to validate the ""point of care"" infliximab assay by comparing it with reference ELISA assays in pediatric patients with IBD;
2. to evaluate the correlation of infliximab and AAF levels, as measured by the above innovative ELISA assays, with response to therapy, compared to traditional assays, in pediatric patients with IBD.

The investigators will also investigate how women with medical conditions access to contraception and family planning fellowship trained specialist. After the baseline questionnaire, there be a 3 month and 6 month follow up questionnaire to investigate continuation and satisfaction with the contraceptive method. This study is unique because it will allow us to explore doing collaborative family planning research at the multiple UC medical campuses.","Many women with complex medical conditions who do not desire pregnancy do not receive contraception counseling from their primary or subspecialty care clinicians, and often they are not using contraception. This is an important deficiency as many have conditions that could worsen with pregnancy or for whom pregnancy can be complicated by the medical condition. Thus it is important for women with chronic disease to only become pregnant if they intend to do so. The United States Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use (USMEC), released in 2010, has greatly enhanced the ability of clinicians to counsel patient with complex medical conditions about their contraceptive options. It summarizes the safety of specific contraceptives when used on women with medical conditions. However, little is known about the contraceptive care of these women. We do not know if the availability of the USMEC has translated into evidence-based contraceptive counseling for these women. Further, little is known about their understanding of the interaction between their disease and pregnancy, their past experience and knowledge about contraception, and their contraceptive decision-making, satisfaction and continuation.

The purpose of the Complex Contraception Registry to is to recruit a cohort of women with complex medical conditions who are seen in contraception referral practices run by family planning fellowship trained physicians. We will assess their past experiences and baseline knowledge, their post-counseling experiences and choice of contraception, and their long-term satisfaction with and continuation of contraception.

The study report a unique case of severe intoxication in a child treated with oral ivermectin to prevent scabies infection. The ABCB1 gene sequencing found the child compound heterozygote for two nonsense mutations, one in each gene copy. The child had inherited from each parent one of the alleles. Each mutation generate a predicted truncated protein that likely lead to ABCB1 loss of function, and the undesirable effects observed.

While in some animals, nonsense ABCB1 mutations can lead to neurotoxicity of several ABCB1-substrate drugs, in humans, ivermectin was considered to have an especially high margin of safety, and nonsense mutations have never been reported before, nor has the neurotoxicity of ivermectin apparently caused by these two mutations never been reported before.

This discovery is of critical importance for the child, since it dictates that clinicians would need to optimize any ABCB1 substrate-based therapy in the future. More generally, such information must be brought to the attention of clinicians' medics, and in particular infectious disease specialists, pediatricians, and general practitioners.

It points the importance of pharmacovigilance, and the benefit of pharmacogenomic genotyping in well-defined phenotype, still too rarely considered in clinical practice before the implementation of a drug treatment.

b9e27a07435429be,NCT01972269,Determination of the Effective Volume of 0.125% Bupivacaine-fentanyl 5mcg/mL in Labour Epidurals,Determination of the Effective Volume of the 0.125% Bupivacaine-fentanyl 5mcg/mL Mixture Used for Epidural Analgesia in Labor,,13-06,"Different medications can be used as analgesics in labor epidurals. Bupivacaine is one of the most commonly used drugs for that purpose. The efficacy of a certain medication injected epidurally depends on the dose that is given. A certain dose can be administered in different concentrations, which will consequently mean different volumes. Studies have been done to determine volumes for different concentrations of bupivacaine. However, those studies fall short in the sense that this information cannot be readily applicable in clinical practice, as we don't use bupivacaine plain. The combination of bupivacaine and fentanyl or sufentanil is common practice, as it is well established that the opioids will reduce the concentration of local anesthetic required to produce optimal effect with the least side effects.

This study is being planned to determine and compare the EV90 of the bupivacaine 0.125%-fentanyl mixture for initiation of labor epidural analgesia, following the administration of the 2 different test doses (3cc of lidocaine 2% or 3cc of the bupivacaine 0.125%-fentanyl mixture) used in our Department.","Epidural administration of local anesthetics during labor produces analgesia, sympathetic block and motor block. The characteristics of the block depend on the volume and concentration of the local anesthetic that is used as well as the use of adjuncts(in our case: Fentanyl). Although many researchers have investigated the efficacy of different drugs at different concentrations, the volumes used have been arbitrary. There is limited data regarding the minimum volume that is necessary for a successful anesthetic for a given concentration of bupivacaine.

This study is conducted as a prospective, randomized, up-down sequential allocation trial. The aim is to determine the minimum volume of 0.125% bupivacaine in combination with 5mcgr/ml fentanyl that will provide effective analgesia for 90% of parturients in the first stage of labor. The verbal numeric rating scale (VNRS) is used to rate the pain felt over the first 20 minutes, where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imaginable. After 20 minutes, if the VNRS was greater than 1, the volume of the bupivacaine/fentanyl mixture was considered inadequate and additional volume of the mixture will be given.

After the randomised test dose of either 3cc lidocaine 2% or 3cc of the bupivacaine/fentanyl mixture is given, the loading volume of the bupivacaine/fentanyl mixture will be given. The volume of the bupivacaine/fentanyl mixture for the first patient was chosen at 10 ml (This is the volume with which is generally started in standard practice), and the dose for each subsequent patient depends on the outcome of the previous injection. Doses will be increased or decreased in increments of 2 ml. If the previous response was ineffective, the next patient will receive 2 ml more than the last patient. If the response of the previous patient is effective, the biased coin up-and-down allocation design, which is used to cluster doses around EV90, will be applied to determine if the dose remains the same or decreases.

40 patients will be included in each group within the study. The target volume, EV90, which is defined as the volume at which adequate response would occur in 90% of patients, will be estimated for each of the two test dose groups using Dixon and Mood method. The 95% confidence interval of EV90s will be estimated and based in comparing the EV90 between two groups. Isotonic Regression method will also be conducted to assess the EV90s. The side effects will also be summarized by the volume levels descriptively.","Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital",OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,80.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,TREATMENT,,,QUADRUPLE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

5a2818022dcdad2b,NCT06479369,A Motivational Training Program for Secondary Physical Education Teachers,A Motivational Training Program for Secondary Physical Education Teachers Based on the Circumplex Model: A Study Protocol of a Randomized Controlled Trial,,PID2021-127897NA-I00,"Introduction: In most Self-Determination Theory (SDT) research, improving (de)motivating teaching styles enables numerous benefits for students and teachers, although there is less evidence on the latter. Although the recent circumplex model provides a fine-grained picture of the different (de)motivating teaching styles (i.e., autonomy support, structure, control, and chaos) that physical education (PE) teachers can use in their lessons, no previous motivational training programs have been based on this model. Moreover, all SDT-training programs have been implemented through different group sessions, but individual sessions have not also been delivered.

Objective: This study outlines the protocol of a motivational training program, derived from the circumplex model, designed to enhance (de)motivating teaching styles among PE teachers. Consequently, this program seeks to improve motivational variables and influence (mal)adaptive outcomes in both teachers and students.

Design: A randomized controlled trial design with a mixed-method approach. Participants: At least 16 secondary PE teachers will be assigned to either an experimental group or a control group, together with part of their students.

Intervention: The training program comprises four face-to-face group sessions and two follow-up sessions (one individual and one group sessions). PE teachers will learn how to support autonomy and provide structure, as well as to be less controlling and chaotic towards students. Over a period of approximately five months, teachers will implement these motivational strategies during their PE classes.

Outcome measures: Different (de)motivating teaching styles, motivational variables, and (mal)adaptive outcomes will be assessed in both PE teachers and their students at three distinct points: before the training program (T1), during the intervention (T2) and at the end of the intervention (T3). Additionally, two discussion groups involving all experimental PE teachers will be held (one following the training program and another at the end of the intervention).

Conclusion: The results from this study could be useful for developing motivational training programs for in-service PE teachers.","Physical Education (PE) teachers hold a pivotal role in guiding students through their learning process. Drawing on Self-Determination Theory (SDT), teachers' (de)motivating style, referred to as ""the interpersonal sentiment and behaviour that teachers rely on during instruction to motivate students to engage in and benefit from learning activities"", is a crucial element in the teaching process. Recent research suggests that PE teachers employ a diverse array of teaching behaviours in their educational practice. Autonomy, competence, and relatedness-supportive teaching behaviours (i.e., need-supportive teaching behaviours) have been positively related to students' autonomous motivation and adaptive outcomes in PE, while the opposite is true for autonomy, competence, and relatedness-thwarting behaviours (i.e. need-thwarting behaviours). Consequently, continuous development teaching (CDT) programs, based on SDT, has increased in the last years. These SDT-training programs, mainly focused on autonomy-supportive strategies, revealed positive effects on students' perceptions of (de)motivating teaching behaviours and motivational outcomes. Over the past decade, SDT-training programs have also demonstrated positive effects on teachers' self-perceptions of certain antecedents, support for autonomy and structure, and various motivational and (mal)adaptive outcomes \[6\]. However, additional research is required, as most studies have not focused on reducing need-thwarting behaviours.

Recently, grounded in SDT, the circumplex model offers a detailed view of the different (de)motivating teaching styles (i.e., autonomy support, structure, control, and chaos) that teachers can adopt in their classes. This circumplex model delineates eight teaching approaches across these four teaching styles. To develop the most effective interventions, it is crucial for researchers to understand the effectiveness of motivational training programs, not only in terms of the four (de)motivating teaching styles but also across the eight specific teaching approaches. Yet, no existing motivational training programs have incorporated this new circumplex approach. This mixed-method study sets out to expand existing knowledge by describing a protocol for a motivational training program based on the circumplex model, aimed at enhancing (de)motivating teaching styles, as well as (mal)adaptive outcomes among PE teachers and their students.",Universidad de Zaragoza,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,900.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,"The motivational process of teachers influences the way they teach PE lessons, which in turn will influence the motivational process of students.",OTHER,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

PSMA is a highly specific prostatic epithelial membrane antigen, which is highly expressed in solid tumors such as Prostate cancer. More than 90% of Prostate cancer cells express PSMA, so PSMA can be used as an important imaging target for Prostate cancer.

The radionuclides used for PET imaging include 18F (T 1/2 =109.8min), which has a suitable half-life and cyclotron preparation to enable the high yield synthesis of 18F labeled tracer, so it can be used in more patients and provided to other departments without on-site tracer production facilities.In addition, coordination labeling method is simple, easy to realize automatic synthesis technology and medicine box preparation.Therefore, 18F-labeled PSMA targeted molecular probe is a hot spot in the diagnosis of prostate cancer.

868eeb0dca5d6cbd,NCT04076969,Integrated Educational Session and Enhancing Compliance Behavior,Effect of an Integrated Educational Session on Enhancing Compliance Behavior Among Pregnant Women With Iron Deficiency Anemia,,00004025,This study aimed to determine the effect of an integrated educational session on enhancing compliance behavior among pregnant women with iron deficiency anemia.The anemic pregnant women in the study group received an integrated health education in one session. While pregnant women who were allocated to the control group received the routine antenatal care and follow up.,"Data collection was conducted between April 2019 and December 2019.This study was grounded in the health compliance model(Heiby and Carlson, 1986) which proposed that elements of engagement between health care providers and patients involve activities that are likely to promote the development of information, produce productive emotions, and help develop the skills required to conduct health behavior. Such aspects of engagement include the healthcare provider listening to the patient's questions, engaging the patient in treatment decisions, and evaluating comprehension of the patient.

For the first interview at 24 weeks' gestation, the pregnant women were re-informed about the purpose of the study and the schedule of follow-up. The baseline data that was gathered included test of the women's Hb levels during their routine antenatal visit, socio-demographic characteristics, and obstetric history. Three follow-up examinations were planned for pregnant women in both study and control groups at weeks 28, 32 and 36 of gestation. In the study group, pregnant women with anemia obtained an integrated health education in one session. The educational session was conducted by the principle investigator (PI) and was steered as 40-minutes session and provided individually to every participating woman. The content of the educational session included; disease specific knowledge, impact of anemia on maternal and neonatal outcomes, management opportunities, effectiveness, advantages and draw¬backs of treatment choices, iron-rich diet recognition, false eating patterns stopping iron absorption, and healthy diet. The PI has adopted the medical recommendations based on dietary guidelines for pregnancy(WHO, 2012). The pregnant women were given a chance to ask questions related to the session and its content. Furthermore, women were educated in recording all food and drink consumed inside and outside of the home, i.e. each meal/dish they got during the reporting duration of their diary, 24 hours of recall for seven days. They were also asked to report the exact portion size of the food by normal household measurements (e.g. plates, pots, cups, spoons, and glasses) or by kitchen scale. Additionally, each woman was advised to select the easiest way to remind her of her vitamin time.

The pregnant women received an educational brochure at the end of the educational session which included all the information given in that session written in Arabic language. The literature-based educational brochure material was reviewed by three experts in the field of maternity nursing prior to the distribution. Each pregnant woman in both study and control groups was evaluated twice at 28 and 36 weeks' gestation for total dietary iron. The dietary iron intake recorded by women has been calculated using the IRONIC-FFQ and revised, when needed, by dietitian who was not involved in the study. In addition, the degree of the women's adherence to medication was measured by counting the total numbers of pills consumed between two scheduled appointments. For antenatal follow-up appointments for all women in the study and the control groups, phone calls were given monthly and women were reminded to record the iron intake diary seven days before their appointment. The participants returned their supplementary bottles with any unused capsules to the PI during their monthly visits to the antenatal clinic. Adherence to the supplementation scheme was determined based on the number of capsules left in the package after each return visit; adherence (percent)=\[30-number of pills left in the package/number of days between the date of dispensation and the date of return\]100. The equation was adopted based on the method used in(Cogswell et al., 2003).

At the last data collection occasion at gestation week 36, the medication adherence scale was inserted along with check of Hb levels for all participating women. Pregnant women who were allocated to the control group received the routine antenatal care and follow-up, but no educational sessions or materials were provided to them

They can have health problems, such as chest infections and malnutrition because when they try to drink, some of the liquid ""goes down the wrong pipe"" and into the lungs. To help people with dysphagia, Swallow Solutions is developing thickened liquids that have added nutrition, taste good, and quench thirst, but are still easy and safe to swallow.","A. Background Dysphagia, a devastating swallowing disorder affecting more than 18M adults and millions more children in the U.S. \[1,2\], is associated with increased mortality and morbidity, including malnutrition, dehydration, pulmonary complications, and reduced quality of life \[3,4\]. Dysphagia often causes thin liquids (e.g., water, coffee) to be aspirated or misdirected into the pulmonary-rather than to the digestive-system during swallowing, significantly increasing the risk of aspiration pneumonia \[5,6\]. Radiographic methods used in \>80% of U.S. hospitals to diagnose dysphagia involve standardized fluids with specific rheological characteristics (e.g., apparent viscosity, flow properties) \[7\]. Thickened beverages are the most commonly recommended intervention after dysphagia diagnosis \[8\]. Perplexingly, currently available dietary beverages differ from the rheological characteristics of standardized diagnostic fluids, causing a critical disconnect between diagnosis and treatment \[9\]. A rheologic study of commercially available thickened beverages and diagnostic fluids found that some commercial nectar products, while approaching the target apparent viscosity (n ) for the diagnostic standard (Varibar® Nectar, n 30=300 cP), differed in other rheological parameters such as flow index (n), consistency (K), and yield stress. o commercial thin-honey consistency products matched the diagnostic standard for any of these rheological parameters. This disconnect frequently causes the bolus to flow toward the airway, increasing the risk of negative health sequelae.

Swallow Solutions, LLC will build on the successful completion of our Phase I project to continue to bridge the gap between clinical need and existing products. Based on insights from our Phase I results, investigators will develop a complete product line (tentatively branded as SwallowSAFE Thickened Beverages) to meet the unique-currently unmet-needs of dysphagic patients. This novel thickened beverage line will provide hydration and nutrition, thus circumventing potentially life-threatening and costly health problems associated with dysphagia. The investigators propose to accomplish the following specific aims.

Specific Aims

Aim 1. Complete a full complement of prototype ready-to-drink, thickened, and nutritionally-enhanced medical liquids that are shelf-stable and appealing, with pre-determined rheological and nutritional properties. T

Aim 2. Demonstrate improved patient safety resulting from novel, biophysically designed thickened beverages (full product line) compared to currently available thickened beverage options.

Aim 3. Develop production for the full SwallowSAFE product line of ready-to-drink, thickened beverages (with and without nutritional enrichment) at 2 target viscosities (nectar and thin-honey) in 1-3 flavors each.

B. Study Design: Clinical Research (Aim 2)

Dysphagic patients (n=200) will swallow prototype beverages (with 10% added barium) and also thickened beverages that are currently on the market (with 10% added barium) during a videofluoroscopic (radiographic) evaluation of swallowing that is part of their standard clinical care.

These incidents may also include peer victimization. Racially and ethnically minoritized youth are disproportionately affected by these incidents and occurrences of racial bias in school. The purpose of the Comprehensive Prevention Strategies (CPS) intervention is to preventatively promote youth safety and belonging across individual, school, and community settings by intervening at multiple entry points. The primary components include: (1) an adapted version of Coping Power and (2) extended PBIS strategies called ""ReACT"" (Racial equity through Assessing data for vulnerable decision points, culturally responsive behavior strategies, and Teaching about implicit bias and how to neutralize it) is for teachers. This project leverages the evidence-based Coping Power student and parent interventions and Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) approaches to include much-needed adaptations to address this critical issue. This project has the potential for important public health outcomes: (a) reducing youth violence, (b) improving school climate and (c) improving teacher practices regarding discipline, disproportionate discipline, and bias in public schools.

Project Aims The primary purpose of this project is to test a comprehensive, two-part intervention with ReACT and a recently adapted, Coping Power+ Program. ReACT and PBIS are school-wide universal interventions. Coping Power and Coping Power+ are targeted preventive interventions designed to assist at-risk 7th grade students to improve their coping with interpersonal stressors during middle school. This project will evaluate the effects of the program on teacher, student and parent perceptions of school climate, student behavior, social-emotional competence, disciplinary infractions, and identity for 7th grade students in Coping Power or Coping Power+

Funding This project is funded by a 5-year grant awarded by the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities.

Sample of Schools A total of 18 middle schools have been recruited for involvement in this project: 11 in Huntsville City Schools and 7 in Jefferson County Public Schools.

Student Participation and Data Collection Students who are identified by teachers and/or school staff as potentially benefiting from Coping Power on the 6-item universal screener completed by 6th grade teachers each project year in the spring, will be contacted by school staff to request active parental consent for participation.

Benefits to Participating Schools To implement the Coping Power and Coping Power+ Programs, clinicians will be hired by the grant and will be co-trained with one or more school-based staff members (e.g., school counselor, school psychologist). In appreciation of staff time devoted to leading the Coping Power groups, the grant will provide a $25 per session donation to the school ($625 per year).

This project will increase the school's capacity to implement an evidence-based Tier 3 prevention program to support students and their families.

Timeline This 5-year project began in 2019 with the development of CP+ adaptations and ReACT strategies for middle school. Study activities were halted in 2020 due to the pandemic. In August of 2021 researchers will continue with ReACT educator training (on full day), then send parental permission forms for Coping Power participation. Coping Power groups will start in September and run weekly for the rest of the year. ReACT training will be followed by monthly one-hour strategy sessions for the remainder of the school year. While ReACT training will be complete, another cohort of 7th grade students will enter Coping Power (screened in each spring) in September 2022 and September 2023. Each year approximately 17 students from each middle school will participate in Coping Power groups.

Expected Outcome Researchers proposed that adapted, culturally responsive Coping Power will be more effective than traditional Coping Power in promoting prosocial behavior for 7th grade participants.

ReACT Teacher Training

ReACT (Racial equity through Assessing data for vulnerable decision points, Culturally responsive behavior strategies, and Teaching about implicit bias and how to neutralize it) is a universal professional development intervention for all school staff to leverage the PBIS framework for increasing racial equity in school discipline (McIntosh, Barnes, et al., 2014). The intervention includes whole-school professional development sessions delivered throughout the year that focus on understanding discipline decision making and the effects of bias, a root cause analysis of discipline data, and creation of a tailored intervention plan with strategies selected to address these root causes.

Middle School Coping Power Child and Parent Program The Coping Power Program is a rigorously tested, multi-component school-based intervention for children and their parents (Lochman \& Wells, 1996), that addresses issues related to aggression and problem behavior. Efficacy and effectiveness studies conducted in multiple schools in Alabama and throughout the United States over the past two decades have found Coping Power to reduce students' levels of externalizing and internalizing behaviors, and substance use, and to enhance students' language artss grades through long-term follow-up periods, in comparison to randomized control and comparison students. families in need of specialized services.

The Coping Power student component is offered to groups of six students at the school and features 25 weekly group sessions, each lasting about 45 minutes. The program includes 12 parenting sessions during which parents meet in groups of 10-12 with two co-leaders.

Aim 1. To determine the extent to which SWPBIS+ training is more effective than SWPBIS alone as a Tier 1, in reducing disproportionate disciplinary practices, and if differences are moderated by student and teacher race.

Aim 2. To determine the extent to which CP+ is more effective than CP as a targeted intervention in reducing interracial and intraracial aggression and if differences are moderated by student race.

Aim 3. To determine the extent to which the effects of CP+ relative to CP differ depending on the Tier 1 context (SWPBIS+ vs. SWPBIS) and whether those effects are moderated by student race.

Compassion is a complex, multifaceted psychological and social process. Professional values form the basis of nursing care. The concept of compassion is one of these professional values, as well as one of the essential components of care that facilitates nursing care. Compassion-based care provides patient-centered care with a holistic approach while increasing the quality of care. Despite this importance, many healthcare professionals remain inadequate regarding compassionate care. The idea that compassion is innate or learned in people causes various difficulties in teaching compassion. Compassionate care is an emotion that can be taught and developed with innovative interactive methods along with developing technology. Methods such as video-supported teaching and case analysis, which are widely used in nursing education, contribute to developing cognitive and affective skills such as interpretation, critical thinking, and problem-solving in nurses. In this context, it is aimed to implement compassionate care training, developed based on Watson's Human Caring Model, on nurses by enriching it with video-supported teaching and case analysis methods, and to evaluate the effect of this training on nurses' compassion levels and caring behaviors.","The research will be conducted as a single group pre-test-post-test quasi-experimental study to determine the effect of compassionate care training, which will be given using video-assisted teaching and case analysis methods according to Watson's Human Caring Model, on nurses' compassion levels and caring behaviors.

The universe of the research will consist of 220 nurses working in the Surgery Clinic, Internal Medicine Clinic, Intensive Care Unit and Emergency Department at Kırıkkale University Faculty of Medicine Hospital between 20.12.2025 and 20.02.2026. The power of the study was measured with the G\*Power 3.1.9.2 package program. The sample size was calculated with a medium effect width. Accordingly, the minimum sample size to be studied for 95% power at a significance level of 0.05 and an effect width of 0.5 was predicted to be 54. The research aims to reach 60 people, considering the losses.

The sample will consist of nurses who meet the research criteria, are not on leave during the research period, and agree to participate in the research.

Implementation of the Research:

Preparation phase:

""Preparation of the Content of the Compassionate Care Education Program to be Given According to Watson's Human Care Model"" Compassionate care training for nurses, based on Watson's Human Caring Model, has been developed in accordance with literature. The training is planned in four sessions. In sessions 2, 3, and 4, videos from the prepared scenarios will be shown, and case studies will be conducted with the nurses (six case scenarios containing compassionate care behaviors and six scenarios containing negative versions of the same scenario without compassionate care behaviors, for a total of 12 scenarios).

Implementation of the Study During the implementation phase of the study, pre-tests will be conducted between December 20, 2025, and February 20, 2026, by asking all nurses, for whom written consent has been obtained, to complete the ""Descriptive Characteristics Form,"" the ""Compassion Competence Scale,"" and the ""Caring Behaviors Scale."" All nurses in the sample group will receive compassionate care training implemented according to Watson's Human Caring Model. During the second, third, and fourth sessions of the training, videos taken from the prepared scenarios will be watched, and case studies will be conducted with the nurses. Following this four-week training program, post-test measurements will be taken by asking them to complete the ""Compassion Competence Scale"" and the ""Caring Behaviors Scale."" After the compassionate care training implemented according to Watson's Human Caring Model, the ""Compassion Competence Scale"" and ""Caring Behaviors Scale"" measurements will be repeated at the end of the first and second months.

All participants in this 12-month RCT will receive cognitive training. Half of the patients will also be randomly assigned to the aerobic exercise and strength training condition, and the other half will be randomly assigned to the Healthy Living Group condition. The primary outcome measures are improvement in cognition and level of engagement in the in-group and at-home exercise sessions. Increases in the level of the patient's serum brain-derived neurotropic factor (specifically Mature BDNF) which causes greater brain neuroplasticity and is indicator of engagement in aerobic exercise, will be measured early in the treatment phase in order to confirm engagement of this target. In order to demonstrate the feasibility and portability of this intervention outside of academic research programs, the interventions will be provided via videoconferencing. The proposed study will incorporate additional methods to maximize participation in the exercise condition, including the use of the Moderated Online Social Therapy (MOST) platform to enhance motivation for treatment based on Self-Determination Theory principles, and a ""bridging"" group to help the participants generalize gains to everyday functioning. In addition, the exercise group participants will receive personally tailored text reminders to exercise.","This R01 confirmatory efficacy clinical trial application involves telehealth delivery of a treatment approach to improving core cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, using an experimental therapeutic design that NIMH has advocated. This telehealth intervention approach combines neurotrophin-releasing aerobic exercise training with neuroplasticity-based cognitive training to enhance the impact of cognitive training on cognition. Telehealth cognitive training and telehealth physical exercise training address the NIMH strategic research priorities for creating innovative interventions that can be ""disseminated broadly"" and ""readily taught to the existing workforce with minimal cost."" Cognitive training and physical exercise have each been shown separately to improve cognitive deficits in schizophrenia to some degree, and previous research has shown that, when combined, show promise of improving cognition and work/school functioning more than either treatment alone. Preliminary studies, comparing the combined treatment with cognitive training without aerobic exercise, found evidence of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) target engagement, differential improvement in cognition, and prediction of later cognitive outcome from initial BDNF gain. The portability of the proposed intervention outside of academic research programs will be demonstrated by providing the interventions via videoconferencing. The proposed study will incorporate additional methods, such as Fitbit wrist-worn fitness trackers, web-based motivational support, and personalized text messages to encourage motivation and to maximize participation in the exercise condition. Mature BDNF will serve as the primary target and cognition will serve as the primary outcome. It is hypothesized that the increases in Mature BDNF associated with regular aerobic exercise provide a platform which allows neuroplasticity-based cognitive training to enhance cognition more quickly than is typically observed in studies of cognitive training alone. It is hypothesized that combining aerobic exercise with cognitive training will produce larger cognitive improvements, relative to cognitive training without exercise, with all interventions conducted remotely via videoconferencing. Further, it is hypothesized that a greater proportion of exercise sessions completed will be associated with greater cognitive improvement. The research will also test whether intrinsic motivation at baseline and increases in intrinsic motivation over time predict the extent of participation in the telehealth physical exercise program. Cognitive deficits in persons with schizophrenia are a major influence on their everyday functioning in the community. The study targets the period shortly after a first episode of schizophrenia to maximize the generalization of cognitive improvement to real-world functional outcome, before chronic disability is established. This telehealth cognitive training plus aerobic exercise clinical trial has the potential to test a hypothesized mechanism of action and to make a meaningful difference in the lives of individuals with severe mental illness.","University of California, Los Angeles",OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,100.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,Randomization to Combined Cognitive Training and Exercise (CT\&E) vs. Cognitive Training and Healthy Living Group (CT\&HLG),TREATMENT,,,SINGLE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

One week is a well-rested (8-9 hrs/night attempted sleep) and another is a sleep-restricted (5-6 hrs/night attempted sleep) condition. In between these two conditions is an ad lib sleep week. At the end of each treatment week, the participants come to a laboratory session to go through a series of decision making tasks. Participants also track dietary intake through the 3-week protocol using the ASA24 website.

This study was fully preregistered on the open science framework (OSF) has has registration DOI at https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/NSPRK","THE PRELIMINARY SCREENING SURVEY:

This short demographic, sleep, and mood survey is administered at least twice a year by the investigator (Dickinson) on random subsets of students at his institution. This database survey had been ongoing for several years and has been approved under separate human subjects approval process, and has been used by the investigator (Dickinson) to recruit for a variety of ""sleep and decision"" research studies over the years.

This short survey provides sufficient information for the investigators to screen out individuals who self-report a sleep disorder, who are not within the 18-40 year old target age range for this study, who are at significant risk of major depressive or anxiety disorder (assessed using validated short-instruments). Viable participants who meet the inclusion criterion (usually, only about 2/3 of those who complete the survey) are randomly assigned to either the control condition or a particular ordering of the treatment condition (SR-WR or WR-SR), ex ante. Afterwards, these individuals are invited to participate in the experiment via email. (note, participants are NOT allowed to opt into a condition or treatment ordering to which they were not randomly assigned)

THE SLEEP PROTOCOL:

The basic sleep protocol will involve recruitment of a total of 130 participants. Participants are randomly assigned to the control condition (N=30) or the treatment condition (n=100). The investigators anticipate some attrition such that n\>130 will be enrolled in the study to ultimately obtain n=130 participants who will have successfully completed the entire protocol.

Both conditions involve 3-weeks of at-home prescribed sleep levels for the participants. For the Control participants, week 1 prescribes 8-9 hours of attempted sleep per night for the 7 nights of that week (refer to this as a well-rested \[WR\] week). Week 3 for Control participants will be another prescribed WR week.

Treatment participants will be prescribed a WR week in week 1 or week 3 and a sleep-restricted (SR) week (5-6 hrs/night attempted sleep) then in week 3 or week 1. That is, treatment participants will be administered the treatment conditions either in SR-WR or in WR-SR order (counterbalanced across participants). For all participants (control and treatment), week 2 is an ad lib sleep week to wash out the treatment effects of week 1 before commencing the week 3 prescribed sleep level.

All participants will complete basic sleep diary records for the entire 3 weeks and will wear a validated sleep-tracking actigraphy device for the duration of the period. Objectively measured actigraphy sleep data will be scored using validated protocols.

The idea of the 3-week sleep protocol is to obtain within-participants measures of decision-making that will be assessed at the end of weeks 1 and 3 (the treatment weeks) with the participant in an experimentally manipulated state of well-restedness or chronic partial sleep restriction (similar to recommended WR levels and levels of SR common in many adult populations).

ADDITIONAL STUDY ELEMENTS In addition to decision making that will be assessed at the end of weeks 1 and 3 of the protocol (i.e., after each experimentally prescribed sleep week), participants will also complete daily food recalls of their dietary intake over the course of the 3-week protocol, as well as a short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and validated measures of cognitive and sleep function at the end of each week of the protocol. The IPAQ, as well as cognitive and sleep function assessments, will be administered online prior to the in-lab decision session at the end of each week (all three weeks). The daily food recalls will be completed online using the Automated Self-Administered 24-hour dietary assessment tool (ASA24).",Appalachian State University,OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,150.0,RANDOMIZED,CROSSOVER,,BASIC_SCIENCE,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

At comparable levels of blood pressure control and proteinuria, patients with ADPKD have faster decline in glomerular filtration rate than those with other renal diseases and do not seem to benefit to the same extent of ACE inhibitor therapy. A reasonable explanation for the above findings is that in ADPKD progression is largely dependent on the development and growth of cysts and secondary disruption of normal tissue. Thus, renoprotective interventions in ADPKD - in addition to achieve maximal reduction of arterial blood pressure and proteinuria and to limit the effects of additional potential promoters of disease progression such as dyslipidemia, chronic hyperglycemia or smoking - should also be specifically aimed to correct the dysregulation of epithelial cell growth, secretion, and matrix interactions characteristic of the disease.

Evidence that specific receptors for somatostatin are present in the kidney tissue, arises the possibility that somatostatin treatment in patients with ADPKD might inhibit fluid formation and eventually induce the shrinking of renal cysts.To evaluate the tolerability and the safety of long-acting somatostatin in ADPKD patients, a prospective cross-over controlled study has been recently performed. This pilot study demonstrated the safety of six month treatment of long-acting somatostatin in patients with ADPKD. Moreover, the percent increase of total kidney volume was significantly lower in patients on somatostatin than in placebo. Overall, these findings provide the basis for designing a long-term study in ADPKD patients aimed to document the efficacy of the somatostatin treatment in preventing further increase or even reducing the total kidney volume and the renal volume taken up by small cysts, eventually halting kidney disease progression.","Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is the most common hereditary renal disease, responsible for 8% to 10% of the cases of end stage renal disease (ESRD) in Western countries.

At comparable levels of blood pressure control and proteinuria, patients with ADPKD have faster decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) than those with other renal diseases and do not seem to benefit to the same extent of ACE inhibitor therapy. A reasonable explanation for the above findings is that in ADPKD progression is largely dependent on the development and growth of cysts and secondary disruption of normal tissue. Thus, renoprotective interventions in ADPKD - in addition to achieve maximal reduction of arterial blood pressure and proteinuria and to limit the effects of additional potential promoters of disease progression such as dyslipidemia, chronic hyperglycemia or smoking - should also be specifically aimed to correct the dysregulation of epithelial cell growth, secretion, and matrix interactions characteristic of the disease.

The fluid filling renal cysts in human polycystic kidney is formed mainly by a secretion process of the tubular epithelium lining the cysts. Secretion and re-absorption take place at approximately the same rate, with secretion slightly higher, so that the amount of fluid in the cysts increases slowly over time. The same process, via the secondary active chloride transport, is also involved in the secretion of fluid into the lumen of proximal tubules in teleost and elasmobranch fishes. Of interest, this process of chloride transport can be markedly inhibited by somatostatin, as demonstrated in the shark rectal gland.

Recently, somatostatin analogues have become available and used with negligible side effects for long-term treatment of tumors (up to 8-12 months). To evaluate the tolerability and the safety of long-acting somatostatin in ADPKD patients, a prospective cross-over controlled study has been recently performed. This pilot study demonstrated the safety of six month treatment of long-acting somatostatin in patients with ADPKD. Moreover, the percent increase of total kidney volume was significantly lower in patients on somatostatin than in placebo. Preliminary data on late stage ADPKD also suggest that loss of renal function in these patients closely correlates with the increase in kidney volume taken by small cysts (\<5 mm3), but not total cyst volume.

Overall, these findings provide the basis for designing a long-term study in ADPKD patients aimed to document the efficacy of the somatostatin treatment in preventing further increase or even reducing the total kidney volume and the renal volume taken up by small cysts, eventually halting kidney disease progression.

Aims

The general aim of the study is to compare the effects on disease progression of three year treatment with long-acting somatostatin or placebo in patients with ADPKD and normal renal function or mild to moderate renal insufficiency. Specifically, the following aims will be pursued:

8b9adf53a9b629e4,NCT07135583,Non-Invasive Interventions for Respiratory Recovery in Chronic Spinal Cord Injury,Non-Invasive Interventions and Biomarker Identification for Respiratory Recovery in Chronic Spinal Cord Injury,Combinatorial,IRBID-2023-1796,"Spinal cord injuries (SCI) can seriously affect a person's ability to breathe. This happens because the injury can damage the nerves that control the muscles used for breathing. As a result, people with SCI often face breathing problems, a higher risk of lung infections, and even early death. While breathing exercises can help strengthen these muscles, they often aren't intense enough to make a big difference, especially in people with long-term injuries.

This research project is exploring a new way to improve breathing in people with chronic SCI. The goal is to ""wake up"" the remaining nerve pathways that still connect the brain and spinal cord to the breathing muscles. By doing this, the investigators hope to make breathing exercises more effective and improve overall respiratory health.

The investigators are testing a combination of two non-invasive (non-surgical) techniques:

Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation (tSCS): This uses small electrical pulses delivered through the skin to stimulate the spinal cord and help activate the muscles used for breathing.

Hypercapnic-Hypoxia Protocol (HiCO₂-AIH): This involves breathing air with lower oxygen and higher carbon dioxide for short periods. This naturally increases the brain's drive to breathe and may help strengthen the breathing muscles.

The investigators believe that using these two techniques together will ""prime"" the nervous system, making it more responsive to breathing exercises. This could lead to better outcomes for people with SCI.

In addition to testing this treatment, the investigators are also collecting saliva and blood samples to look for biomarkers-biological clues that might help predict who will benefit most from this therapy. These include genetic markers and signs of nerve damage in the blood.

Who Can Participate

The investigators are looking for adults aged 18 to 70 who:

Have had a spinal cord injury for at least one year. Have an injury between the neck and upper back (from C3 to T8). Have an incomplete injury (some nerve function remains). Are medically stable and cleared by a doctor. Have at least a 20% reduction in breathing strength. What Participants Will Do

Each participant will complete four rounds of treatment. Each round includes four days in a row of therapy, followed by a three-week break before the next round.

Each daily session lasts about two hours and includes:

Breathing special air mixtures (low oxygen and high carbon dioxide) for short periods, followed by normal air.

A short break. Then, spinal cord stimulation combined with breathing exercises that use resistance (like breathing through a straw).

What the Investigators Will Measure

The investigators will track:

Breathing ability using lung function tests and pressure measurements. Nerve activity using brain and spinal cord stimulation to see how well the diaphragm (the main breathing muscle) responds.

Safety by monitoring oxygen levels, heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing responses during each session.

Biological Samples

Participants will provide:

A one-time saliva sample for genetic testing. A one-time blood sample to look for markers of nerve injury. Why This Matters

This study could lead to new, non-invasive treatments that improve breathing and quality of life for people living with spinal cord injuries. By identifying who is most likely to benefit from this therapy, the investigators can also move toward more personalized and effective care in the future.","The overall objectives of this study are:

To determine whether combining hypercapnic-hypoxia protocol (HiCO₂-AIH) and transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) can enhance the effects of respiratory resistance training in individuals with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI).

To explore whether genetic and blood-based biomarkers can help predict how individuals respond to this combined intervention.

We will test these objectives in adults with chronic SCI using a Williams cross-over design. The study will include 16 participants (with statistical power \>0.8 and α=0.05), accounting for a 20% dropout rate, for a total enrollment of 20 participants.

Specific Aims

Aim 1:

To determine whether four consecutive days of combined HiCO₂-AIH and tSCS will improve the effectiveness of respiratory resistance training compared to either intervention alone.

Outcomes (measured from PRE to 1 day POST intervention):

Primary Outcome: Change in mouth occlusion pressure at 0.1 seconds (P0.1). Secondary Outcomes: Maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure generation, forced vital capacity (FVC), neurophysiological measures of cortico-spinal drive (amplitude of transcranial magnetic stimulation \[TMS\]) and local spinal excitability (amplitude of cervical magnetic stimulation \[CMS\]) in the diaphragm.

Safety Outcomes: Continuous monitoring of respiratory parameters (end tidal oxygen \[O₂\] and carbon dioxide \[CO₂\] concentration, oxygen saturation \[SpO₂\]) and cardiovascular parameters (blood pressure \[BP\], heart rate \[HR\], and electrocardiogram \[ECG\]) during each session.

Aim 2:

To identify predictive factors for treatment response to the combined HiCO₂-AIH and tSCS intervention using:

1. Genetic polymorphisms related to intermittent hypoxia signaling pathways.
2. Molecular markers of neurotrauma and inflammation found in blood extracellular vesicles (EVs).

Methods: The study started from January 2017 to March 2018 and consisted of two stages. The first stage employed Delphi technique while the second an experimental design. An expert panel was invited to develop the integrative learning program based on the neuroplasticity and learning framework in the first stage. A mixed method approach was adopted for the evaluation of the program in the second stage. Questionnaires and clinical instruments were used to collect quantitative data. For qualitative data, verbatim transcripts of case conferences were coded, analyzed, and collapsed into themes and sub-themes by consensus. Results: Quantitatively, significant improvements in the participants' functional performance and well-being in the experimental groups, while qualitatively, improvements on their communications, emotions, connectedness with self and others, and well-being. Conclusion: Overall the evaluation was positive; however, larger sample size of old people from more community care centers would provide more conclusive results.","Stage 1 - The development of the integrative learning program

Delphi technique was employed to gain consensus in the best possible therapeutic interventions for old people with dementia among members of the expert panel. The panel consisted of 8 health professionals including a gerontic care nurse, a registered nurse, an occupational therapist, a physiotherapist, a Chinese medicine practitioner, a mindfulness practitioner, a nutritionist, and a neuroscientist. They all had more than 10 years of experience in their own disciplines.

A research team member explained to the experts individually the purpose of having the Panel and the importance of opinion sharing and idea exchange. Subsequent exchanges covered the conceptual framework, needs of people with dementia, components of the program operation and the intervention protocol. The experts did not meet but to provide their views through emails or audio recordings. Research members organized, collated the views, presented the aggregated views iteratively to each expert for consideration. The exchange on each topic terminated when all experts reached total agreement on their analysis and views were exhausted. Upon completion of each round, a summary was sent to all experts for accuracy checking. With this iterative approach, 12 rounds of exchange were necessitated to develop the complete integrative learning protocol.

To dispel any unrealistic expectations and facilitate learning, training in goal setting skills is needed in the integrative learning program. It was agreed among the experts that people with dementia have different needs and expectations, and various levels of difficulty and ability to meet them, be it basic (novice) or advanced (expert). Hence the Panel formulated a list of developmental needs which are necessary and essential for quality living of people with dementia. The goal of development of each need was also identified based on a novice-expert continuum and the conceptual framework of neuroplasticity and learning.

The Panel reviewed some common dementia management programs used in local institutions. Although these programs have included many contemporary treatment modalities, the results were not marked. The Panel also commented that the treatment modalities could have been sufficient but the piece-meal approach might undermine their efficacy. They concluded that an integrated and structured multi-modality approach together with emotion management should be adopted for the integrative learning program. The multi-modality treatments in the program were structured sessions that employed physical, cognitive, social, and emotional stimulations to intervene dementia. The modalities selected for the program included reality orientation, daily living skills training, reminiscence therapy, multisensory stimulation, fall prevention program, mindfulness activities, Meridian exercise, brain health program (Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar which referred to zither, go, calligraphy and painting) and health education. It was also agreed that case managers, caregivers, and participants were free to choose these treatments or could be assigned to a treatment regime on a 'mix and match' basis to suit their personality traits for improving their abilities to meet their own needs.

Based on the outcome of the above Delphi exercise, the experts brain-stormed the contents and details of each, followed by discussions before resolutions were made by consensus. Consensus was reached for the duration of a standard 3-day protocol and 5-day protocol. The 5-day protocol was an extended version of the 3-day one which allowed the participants to practice more in a designated time. Table 2 shows the 3-day integrative learning protocol. Interventions using the protocol were carried out by case managers who could be nurses, occupational therapists, or other health professionals. These case managers were independent of the research team. To ensure the competency of the case managers, each one had to attend a 3-day training workshop, with one day on theories, another day on practical training by 3 members of the Expert Panel (the gerontic care nurse, the nurse, and the occupational therapist) and the final day on quality assurance.

Stage 2 - Proof of concept: The evaluation of the implementation of the developed program by using a mixed method approach

i) Quantitative Method The study was held in three community care centers run by the same non-profit organization (NPO) and their routine and care provided were the same across their centers. Two types of services were provided in community care centers, residential and day care. The centers were located in different districts where residents were in public housing. Three centers were randomly drawn from the NPO by drawing lots. Eligible older people with dementia from the centers were recruited by convenience sampling. All participants continued with their daily routines and medications during the research period.

Having received consent from both the eligible older people and their relatives, the research team randomly allocated them to the control group (Con), Experimental 3-day normal group (Exp-N) and Experimental 5-day intensive group (Exp-I). For the control group, the participants received conventional therapy which included group activities for reality orientation, reminiscence therapy and activities organized by occupational therapists one hour a day, five days a week. In addition to conventional therapy, the two experimental groups also joined the integrative learning program. For consistency, Day 1 and 3 of the 3-day protocol were replicated as Day 4 and Day 5 of the 5-day protocol.

Allocation concealment was done to avoid selection bias while blinding was done to research assistant who performed data collection. Data were collected before the start of the program (T0) and upon its completion (T2 - at 6th month) for all 3 groups. For the two experimental groups, there was a mid-intervention evaluation (T1- at 3rd month). During the intervention, the trained case managers evaluated the conditions of the participants on a monthly basis until the completion of the program. They joined the monthly case conferences held by the respective centers listening to progress of the participants reported by center staff.

With the adoption of the mixed method approach, quantitative data were collected using 10 validated clinical test instruments while qualitative data were based on the verbatim transcripts of the monthly case conferences.

ii) Qualitative Method For the qualitative data, the verbatim transcripts of the case conferences were used for thematic analysis.

Failures of IUD contraception are mainly due to shifting or expulsion of the IUD. The risk factors for expulsion of IUDs most often found in the literature are young age (\<25 years), the existence of menorrhagia, dysmenorrhea, being a carrier of a copper IUD rather than a levonorgestrel IUD , a history of IUD expulsion, nulliparity, and an anomaly of the uterine cavity unrecognized (fibroma, adenomyosis).

More and more women are turning to menstrual cups (MCs) as a means of periodic protection. But the use of MC has also been mentioned as a risk factor for IUD expulsion (via a suction effect). In May 2013, reports of displacement, rupture, or even expulsion of copper IUDs in CM users were reported to ANSM.

The aim of this proposal is to promote early intervention in the first year of life and to reinforce therapy by ""CareToy"": a portable low cost smart system telemonitored thus augmenting the clinical effectiveness of the therapy while reducing the cost. The smart system is based on a common baby gym, composed of different modules: a) an instrumented baby gym with mechatronic hanging toys, so that the infants' actions on the gym can be measured and stimulated, b) a vision module, for measuring and promoting infants' attention and gaze movements and c) a sensorized mat for measuring and promoting postural control. Each module will also incorporate built-in signal processor, memory and wireless communication. A fourth telerehabilitation module completes the system that allows the system to remotely communicate with the rehabilitation staff for monitoring and assessing the rehabilitation techniques. CareToy and the effectiveness of home rehabilitation based on this system will be validated by clinical trials on at least 50 preterm infants. The result of this project could have a large impact. CareToy may become a commercial product, manufactured on a large scale and distributed not only in rehabilitation centres but also at homes, sold or rented by the Health Care System to families as a therapeutic tool for care intensity.","Study population will be made up of premature infants recruited at the local Department of Neonatology. The eligibility of infants, i.e. children who meet the criteria for inclusion and exclusion, will be evaluated by the Neonatology team. Recruitment should take place after discharge from Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) until the age stated by inclusion criteria and will begin with the signing of the participation agreement by the parents. During the recruitment extensive perinatal data will be collected from medical records. Each clinical centre will maintain these data in an internal database storing. Every child will be evaluated on the basis of a standard neurological examination supplemented by movement analysis on video recording using Prechtl's Method Qualitative Assessment of General Movements.

The sample will be randomized in two groups in order to compare the effectiveness of the CareToy intervention program vs standard care on motor, cognitive and visual development. We designed the study as randomized clinical trial. The sample size was calculated on the basis of the primary outcome measure (Infant Motor Profile \[IMP\], see Outcome measures).

Before the starting of the RCT we have planned a short pilot phase where few infants in order to assess the feasibility of the CareToy training and to tune and set-up the CareToy system and the rehabilitation packages.

As the concept of periodontal tissue-engineering has emerged, many inductive biomolecules were investigated for periodontal regeneration(Bartold et al., 2000).

Vitamin C has shown promising results in periodontal regeneration, in a study vitamin C was suggested to enhance osteoblastic differentiation of periodontal ligament cells through modulating type I collagen-α1β2 integrin interaction leading to increased ALP activity in periodontal ligament cells(Ishikawa et al., 2004). Vitamin C treatment induces expression of cementogenic genes and considered to be a more feasible and safer treatment for clinical cell-based periodontal regeneration(Gauthier et al., 2017).

There is also a study concluding that vitamin C induces the osteogenic differentiation of PDL progenitor cells via PELP1-ERK axis; and this implies that vitamin C may have a potential in the periodontal regeneration(Yan et al., 2013).

Periodontal tissue regeneration aims to increase periodontal in intra-osseous defects thus improving clinical attachment level; reducing probing depth and upgrading the prognosis of teeth(Ramseier et al., 2012).

Resolution of intra-osseous defects through regeneration preserves and improves function and provides patient comfort(Wang et al., 2005).

The aim of this study was to treat the areas with Miller Class I bilateral multiple gingival recession in the maxillary teeth using the Titanium Platelet-Rich Fibrin (T-PRF), an autogenous biomaterial applied in combination with a Modified Coronally Positioned Flap (MCPF) prepared using microsurgical techniques, and the gold standard Subepithelial Connective Tissue Graft (SCTG), to evaluate the efficacy of the treatments and to compare the clinical results 6 months after the treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 20 patients (118 defects), consisting of 13 females and 7 males, with maxillary bilateral Miller Class I gingival recession who were aged between 18 and 65, applied to Necmettin Erbakan University, Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Periodontology and had aesthetic anxiety and sensitivity problems due to multiple gingival recessions were included in our study. As a randomized controlled clinical trial, in the patients' bilateral recession sites, while gingival recessions of one group were treated with T-PRF, the gingival recessions of the other group were treated with SCTG using a simple randomization method. The study protocol was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975, as revised in 2002 and was submitted to and approved by the ethical committee of Necmettin Erbakan University and the Ministry of Health General Directorate of Health Services (protocol number:2019/238). All patients included in the study were given detailed information about the clinical trial, and their written informed consent was obtained. The study was performed between January 2019 and November 2020 in Necmettin Erbakan University Department of Periodontology.

The individuals were divided into 2 groups in accordance with the study protocol:

Group1: SCTG group (n=60) Group2: T-PRF group (n=58) The criteria for inclusion in the study were determined as systemically and periodontally healthy volunteers between the ages of 18-65, the absence of parafunctional habits, non-smoking, the presence of Miller Class I gingival recession defect in teeth located in the bilateral maxillary region, the absence of any hard tissue defects in the relevant region and the absence of a restorative, endodontic procedure or periodontal surgical intervention, a full-mouth plaque score (FMPS) of ≤ 25%, having a marginal gingival thickness of at least 1 mm in the area with gingival recession, the absence of a shallow hard palate dome, having a soft tissue thickness of at least 3 mm, the absence of torus in the area where the graft was taken, the absence of any systemic disease, not using antibiotics for any reason in the last 6 months, the presence of at least 20 teeth in the mouth, not being pregnant and breastfeeding, and patients who applied to the periodontology clinic with various periodontal problems and were indicated for connective tissue graft operation due to gingival recession.

Ependymomas are rare tumors that arise from the ependyma. That is a tissue of the central nervous system. They can develop in the brain or the spine. They are usually treated with surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. Researchers want to see if the new drug marizomib can help people with a certain kind of ependymoma.

Objective:

To see if marizomib stops tumor growth and prolongs the time that the tumor is controlled.

Eligibility:

Adults age 18 and older who have been diagnosed with ependymomas and have already been treated with standard therapies

Design:

Participants will be screened with the following tests or recent results from similar tests:

* Medical history
* Physical exam
* Neurological assessment
* Electrocardiogram (EKG) to evaluate the heart
* Review of symptoms and ability to perform normal activities
* Computed tomographic scan (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to produce an image of the brain or spine.
* Blood and urine tests
* Tests of tumor samples. Participants may have to have new tumor samples taken.

Participants will get the study drug in cycles. Each cycle is 4 weeks. Participants will have up to 24 cycles.

Participants will get the study drug through a small plastic tube in a vein on days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle.

During each cycle, some screening tests will be repeated.

Participants will answer questions about their general well-being and functioning.

About 4 5 weeks after finishing the study drug, participants will have a follow-up visit. They will answer questions about their health, get a physical and a neurological exam, and have blood tests. They may have an MRI or CT scan.

...","Background:

* Ependymomas are rare primary brain tumors arising from radial glial stem cells. They comprise 5.2% of all pediatric primary brain tumors and 1.9% of all adult primary brain tumors.
* The standard therapy for newly diagnosed ependymoma is gross total resection followed by radiation therapy. For anaplastic ependymoma, recurrence rate is high with a median progression free survival (PFS) of 2.3 years.
* There are limited chemotherapy options for recurrent ependymomas, which have already been irradiated. Therefore, there is an unmet need to target novel pathways for treatment of ependymomas.
* About 70% of supratentorial ependymomas have a characteristic signature C11 orf95-V-Rel Avian Reticuloendotheliosis Viral Oncogene Homolog A (RELA) fusion which drives tumorigenesis in ependymomas by activating the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-KB) transcription pathway.
* Marizomib is a second-generation irreversible proteasome inhibitor which penetrates across the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). It inhibits the activity of 20S proteasome in glioma cells, activates caspases, builds up reactive oxygen species and thus induces apoptosis. Marizomib blocks the NF-pathway by proteasome inhibition. Thus, it may have an additional targeted therapeutic effect in the RELA-fusion molecular subgroup of ependymomas.

Objective:

-To evaluate the efficacy of treatment with marizomib in RELA-fusion recurrent ependymoma and non RELA-fusion recurrent ependymoma as measured by progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS6).

Eligibility:

* Histologically proven intra-cranial or spinal ependymoma.
* Radiographic evidence of tumor progression
* Patients must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.

Patients must have had prior radiotherapy.

Design:

* This is a phase II study to determine the efficacy of marizomib in recurrent ependymoma.
* A novel 2-stage sequential design will be employed to conduct the trial for recurrent ependymoma.
* In the first stage, we will enroll 18 patients with RELA-fusion ependymoma and if 4 or more patients in Cohort 1 are progression free at 6 months, we will proceed to stage 2; otherwise, we will terminate the trial and conclude that marizomib is not effective.
* In the second stage, we will enroll 32 patients with non RELA-fusion ependymoma.
* Patients will be treated with marizomib in cycles consistent of 28 days until disease progression or a maximum of 24 cycles.",National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),NIH,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,4.0,NON_RANDOMIZED,SINGLE_GROUP,,TREATMENT,,,NONE,,,"* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

* to see if Pillar implants in combination with CPAP therapy can help people with their OSA by decreasing the CPAP pressures
* to find out if receiving Pillar implants will increase CPAP use","Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is the intermittent cessation of breathing during sleep due to the collapse of the pharyngeal airway. As reported in the April 2004 Journal of the American Medical Association, it is estimated that 59 million people in the United States suffer OSA symptoms. OSA is typically diagnosed through an overnight sleep study (polysomnogram or PSG) in a sleep laboratory or a portable monitoring system. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's (AASM) recommended treatment for patients with OSA is Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), which is a life-long therapy that requires subjects to wear a nasal or facial mask connected to a portable airflow generator while sleeping. CPAP therapy is intended to treat OSA by preventing collapse of the upper airway during sleep with the use of positive pressure. Compliance with CPAP therapy may be a problem as fewer than 50% of patients using CPAP have been considered ""regular"" users due to a variety of factors such as claustrophobia, nasal stuffiness, social factors, and inconvenience.

The Pillar® Palatal Implant System is currently commercially available in the United States, Europe, and other countries to treat habitual snoring and mild to moderate OSA. It is a minimally invasive, well-tolerated procedure that reduces the flexibility of the soft palate and increases its stiffness, which reduces snoring and may limit the palate's ability to collapse into the airway during sleep contributing to clinical episodes of OSA.

The Pillar system consists of a delivery system and an implant. The delivery system is comprised of a disposable handle and needle assembly that allows for positioning and placement of the implants within the soft palate. The 18mm x 2mm implant is a cylindrical shaped segment of braided polyester filaments that is intended for permanent implantation into the soft palate. The needle of the delivery system is inserted into the soft palate, near the hard palate junction. A sliding thumb switch is retracted to deploy the implant. The first implant is placed midline and two additional implants are placed, one on each side approximately 2mm from the midline implant, for a total of three implants.

An antiseptic rinse is recommended pre-procedure and an appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotic should be given both pre and post-procedurally. Local anesthesia is used in all patients. Pain medication is suggested to manage discomfort in the immediate post-operative period.

While the Pillar procedure can be effective in the treatment of mild to moderate OSA, its effect in combination with CPAP treatment has never been studied. In this study, the treatment of OSA using the Pillar procedure in combination with standard CPAP treatment vs. sham procedure in combination with standard CPAP treatment will be investigated. All subjects will be asked to continue their normal use of CPAP treatment during the study. The study will evaluate whether or not the Pillar implants allow less therapeutic pressure to be used in treating the OSA and if less pressure translates to increased usage.","Medtronic Xomed, Inc.",INDUSTRY,,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,51.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,TREATMENT,,,TRIPLE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* Does participation in a 12-week weight bearing exercise intervention change total body lean mass and percentage body fat (as assessed by DXA) in adolescents and adults with Thalassemia?
* Does participation in a 12-week weight bearing exercise intervention change muscle function (assessed by hand grip strength, sit to stand and vertical jump) and endurance (assessed by the 6 minute walk test) in adolescents and adults with Thalassemia?
* Does participation in a 36 week weight bearing exercise intervention (30 min/day; 5x/week) change bone mineral density as assessed by DXA in adolescents and adults with Thalassemia?

Researchers will compare participants' change in body composition, muscle mass, and muscle function during a ""Usual Activity"" period (12 weeks) with an exercise intervention (Period 1: 12 weeks) to see if exercise can improve body composition and muscle function.

The intervention will then be extended an additional 24 weeks for a total of 36 weeks of exercise (Period 2) to explore the change in bone mineral density between between ""Usual Activity"" and ""Exercise Intervention"" (Period 2) in individuals with Thalassemia.

This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled, two-arm, parallel-group, phase 2 clinical trial to determine the efficacy and safety of NONS to treat recurrent acute (bacterial) rhinosinusitis (RARS).

Nitric oxide-releasing solution (NORS) therapy administered as NONS, has the potential to shorten RARS episodes and may reduce the concomitant use of INCS, oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) and oral ATBs used to manage this condition. Suitable candidates will be randomized to a 2-week course of nitric oxide nasal spray (NONS) compared to saline nasal spray (1:1 ratio, administered as five doses daily). RARS symptoms efficacy response will be measured twice daily, after initiation of study medication (Day 1 to Day 15), then once daily to the end of the study (Day 16 to Day 29). The goal of NONS therapy is to accelerate the time to achieve RARS symptoms resolution, defined as a clinical success (cured or much improved sinusitis symptoms; primary endpoint assessment at Day 8), minimize the use of INCS and the avoidance of rescue oral ATBs (both secondary endpoints) over the study period (Day 1 to Day 29). Participants will be enrolled between RARS episodes while asymptomatic, and on study for up to 4 months or until their next recurrence of RARS at which time study procedures and medication begin.

Adults (18 years or older) presenting with a history of mild to severe RARS symptoms (nasal obstruction (congestion), purulent nasal discharge, postnasal drip, headache, facial pain), signs (such as facial swelling), and other nonspecific signs/symptoms of fever and malaise are eligible.

However, EPCs (CD34+/VEGFR-2+) as well as their progenitor cell population CD133+/CD34+ and the population of CD34+ stem cells increased together with VEGF, erythropoietin and angiopoietin-2 levels. Their data suggest that chemotherapy reduces mature CECs, while mobilizing the EPC population. Using real-time PCR and flow cytometry, they also showed that CD146, an endothelial cell specific antigen, was significantly increased in newly diagnosed breast cancer patients compared to healthy controls (23). Other studies also reported increased circulating EPCs in breast cancer patients in addition to CECs (24,25). In another study, circulating EPCs were not increased in cancer patients despite the high plasma VEGF levels (26).

AIMS To determine if the TAA-monitoring device can be used to detect differences in respiratory synchrony in a manner that is clinically applicable. The investigators hope that the device will detect 1) major asynchrony events in a timely manner so as to prompt clinician intervention during future use; and 2) asynchrony events that may be less visible to the naked eye that may be precursors to more severe events.","Respiratory diseases are a major global cause of morbidity and mortality in children. Of patients admitted into a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), respiratory illnesses have been identified as the leading principal admission diagnosis in every age group, accounting for 37.9% of patients under 12 months of age and 28.5% of PICU patients across all age groups. Continuous monitoring of respiratory status is important for the guidance of respiratory support escalation and de-escalation decisions in the PICU. A clinical metric that has been suggested as a signature of breathing effort is thoracoabdominal asynchrony (TAA), the non-coincident motion of the rib cage and abdomen during breathing. A reliable, objective assessment tool for continuous monitoring of respiratory effort could allow for a more complete understanding of patients' real-time respiratory status and provide an additional indication or contraindication for the utilization of various levels of respiratory support. Limiting the use of invasive ventilatory support by early detection of respiratory distress would decrease clinical risk to patients and has the potential to decrease the cost of patient stays in the PICU. The investigators have developed a non-invasive TAA-sensing device designed for use by clinicians to indirectly quantify respiratory effort among pediatric patients (henceforth referred to as the ""TAA-monitoring device""). The device utilizes motion-tracking sensors that capture data that is then processed to provide a quantitative indication of a patient's respiratory status. Given the promising yet inconclusive nature of the evidence supporting the use of TAA as an indicator of respiratory effort, clinical validation of this device is a necessary step to take to support its continued development.",Massachusetts General Hospital,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,20.0,NON_RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,We aim to enroll pediatric patients admitted to the MGH Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU): 10 patients with respiratory distress and 10 patients without respiratory distress.

It is the leading cause of sudden disabilities in adults. Incidence of spastic foot is evaluated at 1 year post stroke from 18% to 56% of hemiplegic patients. Spasticity, defined as an increase in the velocity-dependent response to muscle stretch measured at rest, is part of the upper motor neuron syndrome and is characterized by an increase in tonic stretch reflex. It has been proposed that upper motor neuro syndrome may induce not only spasticity but also other types of muscles overactivity such as spastic dystonia, co-contraction and clonus. In hemiplegic patients, lower limb spasticity within the posterior part of the leg frequently results in equino-varus foot and toes claw. These abnormal postures in hemiplegics may affect activities of daily living such as shoes fitting, balance, ambulation-walking, comfort (pain) and may become irreducible (tendon shortening) if not treated.

In the year 2017, the Italian association for medical oncology (AIOM) recorded in our country about 21.700 new diagnosis of BC men and 5.300 in women. This data show not only a relevant gender disparity on the disease incidence (in 5th to 7th decade male incidence: 11-12% of all new diagnosis of cancer versus 1% in women) but also on the outcomes of treatment. Overall, the 30% of all the new diagnosis have a muscle-invasive (MIBC) onset, the female gender suffer a correlation with a more advanced disease at the time of first diagnosis. As a consequence, men have lower BC-related mortality when compared to women (p\<0,001). This discrepancy in the mortality rate has been investigated by many authors, resulting in the evidence that female gender suffers higher risks, especially during the first two-years after the radical cystectomy. A comprehensive explanation has not been formulated yet, but a multiplicity of cofactors, including variations in the hormone receptors and tumor biology as well as the different anatomy between male and female, have been identified as potentially relevant. Another important issue in the pre-operatory management of female patients with BC is the misleading interpretation of hematuria. It seems to directly correlate with the evidence that women suffer a more advanced stage at diagnosis, and this element has been withheld in the list of relevant risk factors for prognosis. Nevertheless, a thorough analysis of their effect will only be possible in the future, as well-designed prospective and randomized clinical trials are currently not available.

A part from the preoperatory disparity, it has also been described that men are more frequently candidates to an orthotopic urinary diversion, leading female patients to an irreversibly altered perception of personal integrity and body image, namely to a lower quality of life after radical cystectomy. The female anatomy has been considered as a limitation to continence recovery, resulting in preoperative counselling more frequently against in favor of ileal conduit or not-continent urinary diversions.",,University of Florence,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,OBSERVATIONAL,False,ESTIMATED,500.0,,,,,COHORT,RETROSPECTIVE,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Heart failure in these patients is more present than to younger patients, with preserved ejection fraction form (HFpEF). Aging is responsible for the onset of senile amyloid cardiomyopathy. This pathology is still imperfectly understood and its link with the increase in the frequency of HFpEF is important. In addition, specific treatments have just shown their effectiveness.

Multiple trials have proven that providing nicotine-replacement therapies to help smoking cessation were efficacious with various types of populations.

We hope that this tool will improve the ability of HCP to provide optimal, comprehensive care. The study's findings should help to guide future practices for hospitalized smokers.

Currently, standard treatment involves NRT being prescribed completely at the discretion of the physician.

3e3ea7f3a2f6dce6,NCT00000554,Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE),,,98,"To evaluate innovative diagnostic methods that will improve the diagnostic reliability of cardiovascular testing in evaluation of ischemic heart disease in women. Innovative approaches proposed include physiologic or functional measurements such as impaired metabolism, perfusion, or endothelial function as well as assessment of epicardial coronary arteries by angiography. Other objectives include developing safe, accurate, and cost effective diagnostic approaches for evaluating women with suspected ischemic heart disease, and determining the frequency of myocardial ischemia in the absence of significant epicardial coronary stenosis, as well as the frequency of non-ischemic or non-cardiac chest pain. A key aspect of the WISE study is to determine whether evidence of myocardial ischemia occurs in the absence of obstructive coronary disease.","BACKGROUND:

Cardiovascular disease exacts a heavy burden on the health of women. Ischemic heart disease claims the lives of nearly 250,000 women in the United States each year. Recognition of ischemic heart disease in women is a major challenge to the primary care physician. Diagnosis of ischemic heart disease requires recognition of clinical symptoms such as chest pain, or events such as a myocardial infarction, which are evaluated by a physician who will confirm the diagnosis with objective tests. Unfortunately, both symptom recognition and diagnostic tests confuse rather than confirm a diagnosis of myocardial ischemia in women. Chest pain syndromes suspicious for myocardial ischemia are common in women. Noninvasive diagnostic methods which often confirm the diagnosis and assess disease severity in men are less reliable in women. This lack of objective data to support the diagnosis of chronic or acute myocardial ischemia may influence the physician's decision to further evaluate women at risk. With precision in diagnosis, efforts to optimize therapies are hampered.

The detection of epicardial coronary atherosclerosis is a major objective in clinical cardiology. The utility of this approach is well established. However, although the presence of atherosclerosis is sufficient to cause myocardial ischemia, whether significant ischemia or risk of ischemia exists in the absence of angiographic epicardial stenosis, is not known and may be important for women.

Recent progress in understanding the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia provides a more complex causal pathway than the heretofore notion of fixed atherosclerotic obstructions in passive conduits. Diseased arteries which may appear angiographically normal as well as arteries with fixed obstructions can respond to vasomotor influences with a detrimental amount of vasoconstriction. The endothelium generates vasoactive and anticoagulant factors that are important mediators of thrombosis. Cycling hormones may further influence these complex interactions. Methods which do not rely solely on fixed obstruction of epicardial arteries are not only possible but may be useful to recognize early atherosclerosis or, for example, endothelial dysfunction which places the patient at risk for untoward coronary events.

The concept for the study was developed by the Cardiology Advisory Committee in collaboration with staff and was approved by the May 1993 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council. The Request for Proposals was released in April 1994.

DESIGN NARRATIVE:

The Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE) was a four center study designed to evaluate ischemic heart disease and its pathophysiology in women. WISE testing focused on three areas: 1) optimizing symptom evaluation and diagnostic testing for ischemic heart disease; 2) exploring mechanisms for symptoms and evidence of myocardial ischemia in the absence of epicardial coronary artery disease; 3) evaluating the influence of reproductive hormones on symptoms and diagnostic test response. The WISE core data base included demographic and clinical data, symptom and psychosocial variables, coronary angiography and ventriculography data, blood lipoprotein/homocysteine/lipid peroxidation/genetic/hormone/ phytoestrogen analysis, brachial artery reactivity testing, and resting/ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring. Site specific complementary methods included physiologic and functional cardiovascular assessments of myocardial perfusion and metabolism, ventriculography, endothelial vascular function and coronary angiography. Women were followed for at least one year to assess clinical events and symptom status. In the Phase I (1996-7), a pilot phase, 256 women were studied. Phase II has completed enrolling 1008 women in the study. The WISE study defined contemporary and comprehensive state-of-the-art diagnostic testing to evaluate women with suspected ischemic heart disease, and explore sex specific ischemic heart disease pathophysiology.

The study has been renewed through April, 2005 to extend patient follow-up for a minimum of five years. Dr. Kelsey (U01HL64829) of the Data Coordinating Center at the University of Pittsburgh will continue the follow-up, develop sex-specific incremental outcome models to evaluate the prognostic value of female reproductive variables, assess cost effectiveness of the WISE testing techniques, and continue data analyses. Dr. Reis (U01HL64914) will study the immunologic basis of coronary disease in women, focusing on the role of inflammation and cytokine production. He will measure several cytokines and cytokine-related proteins and genotypes in approximately 900 stored samples from WISE participants. Dr. Pepine (U01HL64924) will study the renin angiotensin system in coronary microvascular dysfunction, focusing on whether polymorphisms of the renin-angiotensin/kallikrein-kinin systems and beta-adrenergic receptors polymorphisms are associated with abnormal coronary microvascular function determined by coronary flow reserve measurements.",University of Pittsburgh,OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,,,,,,DIAGNOSTIC,,,,,,Women over the age of 18 who have suspected ischemic heart disease.,False,FEMALE,15 Years,,,,COMPLETED,,2014-04,2001-05,,1999-10-27,2014-04-03,2007-04,ACTUAL,,False,,,,,,,,,,,2025-12-26,False,2014-04-04,,,,,,,,,,,

Participants would be newborn babies or infants approximately at 6 weeks of age ta the time of enrollment. The vaccines will be administered at birth (only for one cohort) and at 6, 10 and 14 weeks. Immune response will be assessed prior to first vaccination, 14 weeks and at 18 weeks of age. The study will also evaluate the shedding of Rotarix virus after a challenge dose administered 28 days after last investigational product administration. Safety assessments will be conducted throughout the study duration.","This is a phase II, observer-blinded, multi-center, randomized and active-controlled study enrolling healthy infants 0-6 days of age or 6-8 weeks of age. The study will enroll infants in six arms divided into two cohorts enrolling infants at birth (0-6 days) and approximately 6 weeks of age. Within each cohort, the enrolled infants will be randomized to the three arms in a ratio of 6:6:5. Participants in Cohort A will receive: RV3-BB/TV P2-VP8 boost (arm 1); RV3-BB/TV P2-VP8 co-administered (arm 2); RV3-BB primed TV P2-VP8 (arm 3), while participants in Cohort B will receive: Rotarix®/TV P2-VP8 Boost (arm 4); Rotarix®/TV P2-VP8 co-administered (arm 5); or TV P2-VP8 alone (arm 6). Rotarix® and RV3-BB will be administered orally whereas TV P2-VP8 will be administered intramuscularly. The study will be conducted as an observer-blinded study wherein the treatment assignment within a cohort will be blinded, although allocation to a cohort will be unblinded due to the difference in age at enrolment between the two cohorts. Participants will receive a dose of injectable or oral placebo to maintain blinding.

A blood sample will be obtained from all the participating infants pre-vaccination and post-vaccination at week 14 and week 18 in both cohorts. All serum samples will be tested for serum IgA binding antibody by ELISA using virus lysates prepared from RV3-BB and 89-12 strains. Additionally, anti-P2-VP8 IgG binding and serum neutralizing antibody levels to each of the 3 strains of rotavirus from which TV P2-VP8 is derived will be determined.

Vaccine safety will be evaluated by 1) recording the immediate adverse events for 30 minutes after immunization, 2) solicited adverse events for 7 days after each study vaccination, 3) unsolicited events for 28 days after each dose, and 4) serious adverse events 28 days after last dose of study vaccination.

All participants in all the study arms will receive a challenge dose of Rotarix® at visit 5following completion of primary series of vaccinations. Stool sample will be collected to evaluate vaccine viral shedding.

The primary objective of the study is to compare the immunogenicity in participants receiving LORV co-administration with TV P2- VP8 or those receiving the TV P2-VP8 booster after receiving a standalone LORV primary series with the standalone LORV. A comparison of immune responses to birth dose of RV3-BB boosted with TV P2-VP8 to TV P2-VP8 administered alone will also be conducted. All primary immunogenicity analysis will be based on LORV specific serum anti-rotavirus IgA antibody concentration. Placebo administration (oral and parenteral) were appropriately placed to facilitate blinding.

There is scientific basis to hypothesize, that cells containing DNA and RNA such as bacteria, viruses and parasites that could be present in blood collected from asymptomatic infected donors are inactivated in the treated whole blood and therefore reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections. The aim of the study is to gather data to support the safety of whole blood products that underwent treatment with amustaline and glutathione and data to support a larger sufficiently powered efficacy study. This study will evaluate the safety of the system for whole blood in adult patients with anemia.

This study is designed as a randomized, controlled, open-label study. The aim is to explore the safety of the whole blood product treated with a PR system using amustaline and glutathione.

The study will enroll 20 patients with anemia. 20 patients will be randomized either to treated WB (Test) or Standard of Care, either Red Blood Cells or Whole Blood (Control).","Screening:

All potentially eligible patients at the participating institution will be approached for study consent prior to study transfusion. Enrolled patients will be asked for consent to the storage of their samples for a future project in TTI Project. Illiterate patients can be consented by an impartial witness.

Patients who consent to the study will be assigned a study ID number and undergo screening.

Screening data collection and procedures will include: Demographics (age, sex), vital signs, height, weight, indication for anticipated transfusion, medical history including history of bleeding and transfusion and concomitant medications. A physical examination, including skin inspection, will be performed. Blood samples will be drawn for a hematological panel (including complete blood count, blood chemistry, blood type, coagulation (aPTT, PT and/or INR) and pregnancy test (if applicable). Immunohematology tests will be performed in a patient's sample at the blood transfusion center. This includes the Direct Antibody Test (DAT), immune reactivity to RBCs that have been processed with the INTERCEPT Blood System (IBS RBC), red cell alloantibody screen (Indirect Antibody Test (IAT) / Indirect Coombs).

Blood samples (pre/post-treatment) for future research on transfusion-transmitted infections will be archived in a biobank of the Institut Pasteur de Côte d'Ivoire (IPCI)

Randomization:

After successful screening, eligible patients will be assigned to a treatment arm by randomization. Randomization will be performed in the blood center by sequentially selecting a randomization envelope starting with the lowest number (e.g., 1 for the first eligible subject in ascending order up to envelope number 20 for the 20th subject).

The ratio of patients assigned to the Test and Control group will be 1:1. Each subject will receive a Test product or SOC. The assigned blood product number must be noted on the randomization assignment envelope and on the release form. The product number will also be entered into the case report form (CRF).

The replacement strategy in this Phase I clinical trial is based on the aim to reach twenty evaluable patients (""evaluable patients"" is defined as those patients who are randomized and receive any study transfusion).

If a randomized subject withdraws or is withdrawn from the study prior to the administration of any study transfusion, or does not receive any study transfusion through 7-days post-randomization, this subject will be replaced by the next eligible subject using the same randomization envelope. If a randomized subject receives a conventional (untreated) blood transfusion prior to study transfusion, the patient will be replaced as described above.

All patients who received at least one study product will be included into the analysis of evaluable patients and followed up to the final study visit on Day 58.

All used and unused randomization envelopes will be kept in the Site File for reconciliation.

Pre-transfusion visit:

Vital signs, height, weight, hemoglobin will be assessed and urine dipstick test for detection of blood will be performed. If the patient consented to future research on TTI, a sample is drawn.

Treatment:

Patients will be transfused with one investigational product or SOC on Day 1. In case he or she requires further transfusion support to treat anemia, enrolled patients may be treated with a second study transfusion. A patient who requires a second blood component will receive a second treatment with a study product from the assigned treatment arm. This patient will be included into the analysis of evaluable patients and followed up to Day 58, the end of study visit.

Post-transfusion visit(s):

Patients will be hospitalized for 24 hours after each study transfusion to allow close monitoring and data collection uniquely for the study purpose since their condition would allow an outpatient treatment. 3 hours and 6 hours after initiating each study transfusion vital signs, skin inspection, and urine dipstick will be performed.

24-hours post-transfusion vital signs, concomitant medication/intervention will be assessed, laboratory samples for hemoglobin, coagulation assays (aPTT, PT and/or INR) and potassium and a sample for determination of residual S-300 will be taken.

If a subject consented to future research on TTI, a second blood sample (post-transfusion) will be taken and archived in the biobank.

In case clinical symptoms of transfusion-related bacterial contamination occur, a blood sample will be taken during the post-transfusion period and sent for microbiological analysis. Those patients will be treated according to local SOC.

Safety Follow-up visit Day 28 (+/-3 days after last study transfusion):

At day 28 (+/-3 days) a physical examination, vitals and blood samples will be collected for laboratory analysis of safety variables (e.g., complete blood count, coagulation, blood chemistry) and urine dipstick.

All Adverse Events (AE), Transfusion Reactions (TR) and unanticipated adverse device effects will be reviewed and recorded for the period from the first study transfusion through day 28 after the last study transfusion.

The Investigators will assess each AE/TR for relation to the study transfusion. Available clinical diagnostic tools will be used to classify occurring transfusion reactions by the definitions of Swissmedic grading scale.

Final study visit Day 58 (+/-7 days after last study transfusion) At the final study visit, the immune reactivity of patient serum to RBCs treated with amustaline/GSH and a DAT test will be performed.

SAEs will be reviewed and recorded for the period of 58 days up to the final study visit.

AFD can involve various organs and lead to a series of clinical abnormalities. Left ventricular hypertrophy in middle-aged men is one of its life threatening complications. It was shown that pending the absence of myocardial replacement fibrosis, substitution therapy could improve myocardial morphology and function as well as exercise capacity. Today, there is no available marker of the efficacy of the treatment on the heart morphology and function.

The T1 time (or longitudinal relaxation time) is one of the major components of the image formation in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (along with T2 time and proton density). Several techniques have been described to assess the myocardial T1-time.

One of them called MOLLI (Modified Look Locker Inversion Recovery), was made available in research centres by the Siemens company. In a study published in 2013, Sado et al. showed in a series of various conditions (hypertension, AFD, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, AL amyloidosis, aortic stenosis and healthy volunteers) that a septal T1 below a threshold of 940ms could discriminate AFD patients. No overlap was shown with other conditions in this study. Our experience with T1 mapping supports that finding (even though our threshold could be slightly different), and we could recently detect by MRI a number of AFD patients, some of them with hypertrophy, some others without hypertrophy. The effect of Replagal® on the T1 relaxation time remains unknown.

The purpose of that study was to follow-up the heart morphology, function and myocardial T1 relaxation time in a population of treated/untreated patients.",,"University Hospital, Rouen",OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,25.0,NON_RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,DIAGNOSTIC,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

670c5b44d14d1abf,NCT02680405,Identification of Epidermal Signatures in Patients With Atopic Dermatitis,Identification of Epidermal Signatures in Patients With Atopic Dermatitis,,HS-2930,"Atopic dermatitis is a skin disorder with an itchy, red skin rash. This may be because certain proteins are increased in the skin of AD patients. The increased expression of these proteins play an important role in the development of AD and may increase the risk for persons with AD to get skin infections and allergies.

There are very few non-invasive ways to diagnose and monitor the development and progression of atopic dermatitis. The goal of this study is to develop laboratory tests, done on skin samples collected by tapy stripping, that can be used for early detection and monitoring the response to treatment for a variety of skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis.","Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a highly pruritic, chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects up to 25% of children and 10% of adults. Atopic skin disease is associated with significant morbidity as well as physical, psychological, and economical quality-of-life impairment. The economical impact of AD and the requirement for family support can be extraordinary and may be greater than what is typically found for asthma and type I diabetes, respectively. In many patients, the early onset of AD is the first clinical manifestation of allergic disease and often triggers the atopic march, the subsequent development of food allergy, allergic rhinitis, and asthma. The skin of AD patients is characterized by an increased Th2 axis, cellular infiltration and significant epithelial inflammation. These factors permit increased penetration of invading allergens and pathogens that further drive AD pathogenesis and pruritus (itch). Approximately 90% of AD patients are colonized with S. aureus, while only 5 - 30% of non-atopic individuals are colonized. Novel therapeutic approaches are currently in clinical trials which provide the opportunity to target pathways integral to AD disease pathogenesis. In recent years, it has been shown that AD is more heterogeneous than initially perceived. Since novel therapeutics target different pathways, one therapeutic approach may not work for all AD patients and each therapy may provide a different level of clinical benefit. Additionally, since AD manifests primarily in the skin, blood collection and analysis may not be the most indicative measurement to determine which therapy is best for each patient. Despite improved understanding of AD, validated methods to non-invasively diagnose and monitor the development or progression of AD are sorely lacking. Additionally, a non-invasive method is needed to understand inflammation at the site of disease manifestation and potentially identify which biological pathways are most relevant for a given patient. This will allow a more personalized approach to treatment of patients with AD.

The investigator has hypothesized that skin proteins are differentially expressed in the upper layers of disease versus non-disease skin tissue and that these may be used as biomarkers for skin changes linked to the development of AD. Previously a method for comparing expression of skin proteins by extracting proteins from tape strips and evaluating differences using mass spectrometry-based proteomics was developed. This non-invasive method is suitable for use in all AD patients and has been used to show an increase in specific skin proteins in AD patients versus normal controls. Despite this success, additional studies are needed to compare gene and protein expression obtained from tape strips with genomic and proteomic profiles from full thickness skin and whole blood. This proposed study will determine the validity of using non-invasive tape stripping, as a surrogate for skin biopsy and whole blood collection, to identify the inflammatory pathway most up-regulated in a given AD patient. This information will be used in defining biomarkers that will facilitate personalized medicine approaches using emerging novel therapeutics.",National Jewish Health,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,OBSERVATIONAL,False,ESTIMATED,50.0,,,,,COHORT,PROSPECTIVE,,SAMPLES_WITH_DNA,"Skin biopsy, blood","Inclusion Criteria:

This rhythm affects factors like body temperature, sleep and Heart Rate Variability (HRV). Dietary choices influence these physiological processes of the body. Poor sleep quality can increase stress and raise levels of a hormone called cortisol, affecting our heart and insulin levels. Heart rate variability (HRV) which is the time between heartbeats, is also influenced by sleep and the body's rhythm. Lower HRV levels have been linked to heart and mental health issues. Little research is present on the effects of post-dinner snacks and pre-breakfast interventions on sleep quality, Heart Rate Variability (HRV), temperature, Interleukin-6, and cortisol levels. It is hypothesised that eating a post-dinner snack and first pre-breakfast will affect sleep quality, heart rate variability, IL -6, cortisol levels and temperature in healthy males.","The body's internal clock, circadian rhythms, works on a 24-hour cycle and is managed by a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. These rhythms control various bodily functions like temperature, hunger, emotions, and even our sleep-wake cycle. During sleep, hormones like cortisol, growth hormone, and insulin influence processes such as glucose metabolism. For instance, insulin levels drop while we sleep to allow the body to use stored energy, but rise again before waking. Poor sleep quality, even with adequate duration, can lead to increased stress and elevated cortisol levels, potentially affecting insulin and heart health. Heart rate variability (HRV), is the variation in time between heartbeats and is influenced by factors like stress, diet, and sleep quality. Lower HRV levels are associated with cardiovascular and mental health issues. Disruptions in the circadian sleep cycle can also affect the gut-brain axis, which involves communication between the gut and the brain via the vagus nerve. This axis influences gastrointestinal function and can impact inflammatory markers like interleukin-6 (IL-6), which in turn affect HRV and cardiovascular health. Dietary choices play a significant role in shaping the body's physiological processes. Nuts can positively impact HRV and sleep quality due to their nutrient content. A post-dinner snack consumed about three hours after dinner and a balanced pre-breakfast meal is important for maintaining stable blood sugar levels and overall health. Nuts, such as peanuts, almonds, cashews, pistachios, and walnuts, along with raisins, offer numerous health benefits. These contain fibre, protein, healthy fats, and essential nutrients that promote satiety, metabolic well-being, and digestive health. Thus this research aims to investigate the effects of post-dinner snacks and pre-breakfast interventions on HRV, sleep quality, IL-6, cortisol, and temperature. By exploring the relationship between dietary choices and physiological processes, we hope to gain insight into how to optimize health and well-being.

The participation will go through 2 assessments; at baseline and after intervention.

This immunological endpoint was chosen as the primary based on the data showing the Sipuleucel-T immune parameters correlating with overall survival from the pooled analysis phase III trials of Sipuleucel-T (Sheikh NA et al. Cancer Immunol Immunother 2013). Secondary endpoints include other immune parameters related to the Sipuleucel-T, including (1) APC cumulative activation (CD54 upregulation), (2) APC number and (3) total nucleated cells (TNC) count, which also have correlated with survival outcomes and clinical endpoints, and (4) T cell proliferation response to PA2024 and PAP, (5) ex vivo cytokine profile and (6) humoral response to PA2024 and PAP, clinical endpoints including: (7) PSA50 response rate (PSA50 RR), (8) objective response rate (ORR), (9) radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), and (10) overall survival (OS), (11) safety and tolerability. We hypothesize that BAT potentiates the anti-tumor immune response and enhances clinical outcomes when given before and concurrently with Sipuleucel-T. Secondarily, we also hypothesize that the clinical activity of BAT will increase with concurrent Sipuleucel-T, as measured by PSA50 response rate and objective response rate compared to historical controls.

Endosonography with mediastinal/ hilar nodal sampling is the test of choice to diagnose sarcoidosis stage I and II - in case tissue verification of noncaseating granulomas is indicated. However, the optimal endosonographic approach (endobronchial or transoesophageal) for mediastinal nodal sampling is under discussion.

Secondly, which needle size or type provides optimal tissue sample quality for granuloma detection is unknown. The novel 25 Gauge (G) beveled ProCore needle, allows tissue acquisition of small core biopsies in addition to cytological aspirates.

Hypotheses:

1. Esophageal ultrasound guided (EUS-B) sampling of intrathoracic lymph nodes has a 14% higher granuloma detection rate compared to endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) guided nodal sampling in patients with suspected sarcoidosis stage I/II.
2. 25G ProCore needles provide superior sample quality compared to conventional 22G needles in patients with suspected sarcoidosis stage I/II.

Study design:

Investigator initiated, randomized clinical trial. Setting: International, multicenter (university and general hospitals)

Study population:

Consecutive patients with a clinical and radiologic suspicion of sarcoidosis stage I or II and an indication for tissue verification of non-caseating granulomas are eligible for inclusion.

Intervention:

EBUS vs EUS-B, simultaneously comparing the standard vs novel ProCore needles.

Main study endpoints:

1. The granuloma detection rate of endobronchial (EBUS) guided sampling of intrathoracic lymph nodes compared to esophageal (EUS-B using the EBUS scope) guided sampling in patients with suspected sarcoidosis stage I/II.

These tactics include humiliation, intimidation, coercing, shaming, malicious teasing, shunning, and using other forms of emotional abuse in an attempt to harm others. Although aggressive behavior is typically common among younger children, most children become less aggressive as they mature and develop better interpersonal skills. However, consistent aggressive behavior can lead to further problems and increased violence in the aggressor. In this study, a social cognitive anger management group intervention called Friend to Friend (F2F) will be evaluated as a way to develop more productive social and emotional functioning among relationally aggressive urban African American girls.

Participants will be randomly assigned to either the F2F program or a psycho-educational attention control (PAC) group. All participants will attend 40-minute treatment sessions twice a week for a total of 10 weeks. The sessions will occur during the girls' lunch or recess period. Participants assigned to the F2F program will learn how to identify signs of physiological arousal, react to a potential conflict while generating alternatives to the solution, and apply previously discussed social cognitive strategies to different situations. Culturally specific cartoons, videotape illustrations, and role playing will be used to portray these improved strategies and behaviors. Participants assigned to the PAC group will learn different organization and homework strategies as well as how to improve their study skills in an attempt to improve their overall academic performance.

Present in 10% of blunt trauma admissions. Pain associated with rib fractures can result in compromise of pulmonary function causing hypoxaemia or pneumonia, which may require mechanical ventilation. Adequate relief of rib fracture pain allows the patient to breathe deeply, avoid intubation and clear secretions effectively, which will minimise the pulmonary complications .

Pain control is essential for not only primary pain relief but also preventing secondary complications such as atelectasis or pneumonia as well as the transition to chronic pain. Accordingly, further steps are now being taken from the conventional pain control medication and techniques by the introduction of more aggressive pain control measures .Traditional regional anaesthesia (RA) techniques such as paravertebral, intercostal and epidurals injections are resource-intensive and time-consuming, limited to single dermatomes; provide incomplete analgesia of the hemithorax; and are associated with significant potential complications such as local anaesthetic intoxication, vasovagal syncope, hemi diaphragmatic paresis and pneumothorax .

The erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is a novel fascial plane block. Its use has been documented in numerous instances with positive outcomes in controlling acute as well as chronic pain. The most popular technique was the continuous infusion through a catheter . Fascial plane blocks that can be used for rib fracture pain management are serratus anterior plane block, erector spinae plane block and the rhomboid intercostal and subserratus (RISS) block. The procedure is more simple to use with a lower incidence of complications ,less time consuming , more superficial than others so it can be used in patients on anticoagulant therapy .

A Retrospective Data Review.,ECMO,MRC-01-22-574,"Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) support is a lifesaving tool used to treat cardiogenic shock, acute heart failure, or extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation(CPR). However, its use is associated with significant complications, including mortality. We aim to conduct a retrospective observational study of all patients at Heart Hospital who required VA-ECMO support due to cardiogenic shock during 1/06/2016 and 1/06/2022 to report the incidence of in-hospital mortality among patients who required VA-ECMO along with the predictors of mortality. Data will be collected to identify baseline characteristics and outcomes including clinical variables predictive of poor outcomes.","Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is an advanced life support modality for critically ill patients with refractory cardiac or respiratory failure. It is a temporary support for cardiorespiratory failure, bridging time for recovery or permanent assist. Besides, ECMO could be used in a variety of clinical presentations, such as severe traumas, extracorporeal-assisted rewarming (ECAR) of accidental deep hypothermia, and can be used as a bridge to lung or heart transplant.

Cardiogenic shock can be a fatal condition with poor prognosis. Conventional treatments for cardiogenic shock include vasopressor agents guided by invasive monitoring, and intraaortic balloon pump support. There has been growing interest in the use of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) as a salvage therapy for patients in cardiogenic shock refractory to conventional treatments. However, there is a low rate of survival to weaning or bridging therapy among patients with cardiogenic shock requiring ECMO (42-56%). Moreover, VA-ECMO use is associated with complications, including bleeding, renal failure. Thus, the benefits of this potentially life-saving support is still subject to discussion, especially for VA-ECMO use in the setting of cardiogenic shock as the evidence is scarce. Therefore, it important to identify the patients' related factors that may be associated with poor outcomes using real-world data. We will conduct a retrospective observational study of all patients at Heart Hospital who required VA-ECMO support due to cardiogenic shock during 1/06/2016 and 1/06/2022 with the aim of quantifying the incidence of in-hospital mortality among patients who required VA-ECMO in the setting of cardiogenic shock along with determining the predictors of mortality.",Hamad Medical Corporation,INDUSTRY,SPONSOR,OBSERVATIONAL,False,ESTIMATED,120.0,,,,,COHORT,RETROSPECTIVE,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

These range from a simple asymptomatic carriage up to 20 % of children , or minor illnesses such as sore throat or impetigo, to severe conditions such as necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome .

The pathophysiological mechanisms of invasive GAS infections are poorly understood. These mechanisms could involve not only virulence factors of the bacterium ( M protein determines the emm genotype , but also super- antigenic exotoxins SpeA , Spe C, Ssa, Sme z or other virulence genes , SilC , ... Sic ), but also in some cases, factors associated with host immunity in particular in the absence of risk factors for invasive skin infection such as cutaneous effraction ( wound , burn , chicken pox ) , corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive therapy and recent surgery .

The investigators assume that in some invasive GAS infections, especially in children without risk factors, Mendelian susceptibility to infection may be involved . This hypothesis could be tested by studying the molecular characteristics of strains isolated SGA and innate and adaptive immunity in children hospitalised for invasive GAS infection with or without identified risk factors for infection.

This study could not only lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of invasive GAS infections but also to detect in children who underwent invasive GAS genetic susceptibility to infections requiring specific care . Finally, it could also identify specific strains of SGA or molecular profiles, whose detection in practice, lead to a suspicion of hereditary immune deficiency.",Assistance Publique - Hôpitaux de Paris,OTHER,SPONSOR,OBSERVATIONAL,False,ACTUAL,223.0,,,,,CASE_CONTROL,PROSPECTIVE,,SAMPLES_WITH_DNA,serum,"Inclusion Criteria:

The views generally utilized include the lateral, base and frontal. This technique requires the subject to provide specific speech patterns, as presented by a speech pathologist, while a radiologist obtains adequate views of the velopharyngeal (VP) port. Each procedure will take about 3 to 5 minutes. Fluoroscopic imaging is provided only during speech tasks and swallowing limiting radiation exposure.

1\) The radiologist begins by taking a lateral view while speaking, which allows viewing of the velum and posterior pharyngeal wall during speech production, as well as evaluation of cranial base angle, size and location of adenoid tissue, velar length, velar thickness and velar stretch. 2) The speech pathologist gives the subject barium sulfate contrast, approximately 2 to 4 oz, to swallow, which allows for better structure delineation, as well as the confirmation of the presence of palatal fistulae if barium passes through the palate during swallowing. 3) The speech pathologist places the subject in a supine position and barium sulfate is then instilled into the nasal passages bilaterally via syringe, approximately 5 ml. approximately 2. 5 ml in each nostril. This allows for nasopharyngeal coating of structures. 4) The speech pathologist then places the subject in the prone on the table and positioned into a sphinx position with head and neck extended and forearms and palms flat on the fluoroscopic table. The head, shoulders and neck are positioned to find the base view of the velopharyngeal port. This view affords the ability to obtain velopharyngeal closure patterns and size of velopharyngeal defect similar to that of nasopharyngoscopy. 5) The next view obtained by the radiologist is the frontal or anterior-posterior. This is obtained with the head/neck extended to allow for evaluation of the degree of lateral pharyngeal wall motion. 6) The final view obtained by the radiologist is a repeat of the initial lateral view this time with the nasopharyngeal coating in place. This can be beneficial in confirming VPI in the presence of a small VP gap. During the coated lateral view blowing of barium through the VP port can be observed. Additionally if barium is not dissipated during velopharyngeal closure this can be indicative of anatomic VPI.

Before and after the intervention the patients were tested regarding Oral Glucose Tolerance Test, blood pressure, weight and fat% and VO2max. A pilot study was conducted with 6 patients with type 2 diabetes using the same protocol but only 6 times of training.","The aim of the study is to investigate to which extent a short period of HIT can improve cardio-metabolic status measured by simple methods such as OGTT (fasting glucose and 2h-glucose), blood pressure, weight and fat percent in patients with type 2 diabetes

Protocol:

At day -2 a VO2max test was performed in order to get familiarized to the test before the actual test at day 0. The pretest at day 0 was carried out at least two days before the first training session in order to allow patients to recover after the Vo2max test before training. After 8 times of training the posttest was accomplished at day 21 two days after the last training session in order to avoid the acute effect of training. Both pre- and posttest were carried out on Fridays and training days were Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

The pre- and posttest contained the following: Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), blood pressure measurement, weight and fat% measurements and VO2maxtest. Pretesting also contained a questionnaire about physical activity and their medical history in addition to the physiological tests.

Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT): Participants were instructed to continue a normal diet in the days leading up to the test. At the day of testing they should meet fasting (for at least 10 hours) and they were asked not to take any medications that could influence blood glucose levels in the fasting hours (two forgot and they were instructed also to take medications prior to the posttest). At baseline a small blood sample was collected by the use of a finger prick to determine fasting capillary blood glucose level (producent). The fingertip was disinfected before the finger prick and the first drop of blood was removed before applying a drop of blood in the glucose meter. The participants were then instructed to drink 75 mg of glucose dissolved in 300 ml of water. Blood samples were collected after 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes with the use of finger prick.

Blood pressure: Blood pressure was measured after 10 min of rest in a sitting position. An automatic blood pressure monitor was used (producent) and three measures were made. The lowest of the three values were used in calculations.

Weight and fat%: Weight and fat% were measured on a Tanita digital scale with bioelectrical impedance. The participants were instructed to step on the scale barefooted and to keep the hands with the handgrips slightly elevated from the torso.

VO2max: Bicycle test on a Lode ergometer bike to exhaustion with direct measurement of oxygen consumption by Breath-by-breath on Masterscreen CPX. The participants were instructed about the protocol before applying the equipment used for the test. Then there was a warm-up for 5 min. on 50-75 watt followed by incremental increase in intensity by 25 watt each minute until exhaustion. The test was considered a VO2max if the RER-value exceeded 1,10. Otherwise, is was categorized as a VO2peak test.

Physical activity: Physical activity was assessed by using the Physical Activity Scale (PAS) questionnaire (19). PAS1 was used instead of the PAS2 as not all the participants were working in the daytime. The participants were asked to report time spend on different activities on an average weekday before the intervention. These activities are categorized into nine different categories with a corresponding metabolic equivalent (1 MET \~1 kcal/kg/h) ranging from low to high intensity. A total MET-score was calculated as time spend on each category multiplied by the corresponding MET and then all nine categories were added together. The categories are sleep (0.9 MET), TV-viewing/reading (1.0 MET), sitting/working (1.5 METs), standing up (2.0 METs), light work (3.0 METs), light to moderate activity (4.0 METs) moderate activity (5.0 METs), moderate to high activity (6.0 METs) and high intensity activity (\>6 METs). As for the high intensity 7 METs was chosen in this study.

Training: The training consisted of 10 x 60 sec work on an indoor exercise bike at an intensity of \~90% of max HR interspersed by 60 sec of recovery 3 times per week (Mon-Wed-Fri) with a total amount of eight training sessions. This protocol was the same as used by Little et al (2011). The pedal cadence was individually set in the area of 80 -110 rpm. In the recovery the participants pedalled slowly at a lower intensity (\~ 50 watt). The HR used for training was calculated based on the max HR found by VO2max test at pretest. Each interval was scored on Borg Scale (rate of perceived exhaustion, RPE) which is a subjective scale where the participants experience of exhaustion is expressed in a number from 6 to 20. 14-15 is determined as where speaking in sentences is interrupted by breath and at 16-17 there is a clear hyperventilation. Perceived enjoyment of low-volume HIT was assessed by asking participants how enjoyable they would find engaging in 1) a single bout of HIT (10 x 1 min) and 2) HIT at least 3 times/wk for the next 4 wk using a 9-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not enjoyable at all) to 9 (very enjoyable).",University College of Northern Denmark,OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,16.0,NON_RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,A pilot group of 6 patients with type 2 diabetes tested before and after 6 times of High Intensity Training One group of patients with type 2 diabetes tested before and after 8 times of High Intensity Training.,TREATMENT,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Levonorgestrel is commonly prescribed as part of a combination OC. An intrauterine device (IUD) is a device inserted in a woman's uterus to prevent pregnancy. The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of a levonorgestrel-releasing IUD on the amount of HIV present in an HIV infected woman's cervix after 4 weeks of IUD use.

Study hypothesis: There will be no increase in genital tract HIV RNA and DNA after placement of the levonorgestrel IUD.","HIV infected women face the challenges of preventing both pregnancy and HIV transmission to their sexual partners. However, OCs may interact with antiretroviral therapy (ART), and data suggest that higher doses of OCs may increase cervical shedding of HIV-1, which may increase an HIV infected woman's infectiousness to her sexual partners. A physical barrier contraceptive would be useful to HIV infected women to circumvent the problems associated with concurrent use of OCs and ART. The levonorgestrel IUD has proved highly effective in preventing unwanted pregnancies in HIV uninfected women since its introduction in the United States in 1999. This study will evaluate the effect of the levonorgestrel IUD on HIV viral load in an HIV infected woman's cervix after 4 weeks of IUD use.

This study will last approximately 48 weeks; there will be 4 study visits. At screening, participants will undergo medical and medication history assessment; a complete physical exam; a pelvic exam, including genital tract sample collection; blood collection; sexually transmitted disease (STD) testing; and a Pap smear, if needed. The levonorgestrel IUD will be inserted into the participant's uterus at study entry. At study entry and at Weeks 4, 16, and 48, participants will undergo a targeted physical exam; a pelvic exam, including genital tract sample collection; and blood collection. Participants will be given a menstrual diary at the start of the study and at each study visit and will be asked to document all menstrual cycles they have for the duration of the study.

To be eligible for this study, participants may not have had ART within 90 days prior to study entry. However, after the Week 4 study visit, participants may reinitiate (if they were on ART more than 90 days prior to study entry) or initiate (if they are ART naive) ART, if deemed necessary to do so by their physicians.",National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),NIH,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,,41.0,NON_RANDOMIZED,SINGLE_GROUP,,PREVENTION,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

The treatment period will consist of a two-week titration period followed by a 2- week maintenance period. In addition, the study seeks to examine whether changes in sleep disturbances precede changes in anxiety symptoms.","Approximately one-third (33.1%) of Americans will experience an anxiety disorder at some point in their lifetime. Anxiety disorders are primarily treated with antidepressants or benzodiazepines, but unfortunately, many patients report a partial response or cannot tolerate the side effects of these medications, which include risk for abuse, cognitive impairment, and even death. The therapeutic potential of various compounds derived from the Cannabis sativa plant has generated considerable interest, particularly for managing neuropsychiatric disorders that have limited treatment options. Among these compounds, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), have received significant attention. CBD has shown a unique pharmacological profile that lacks the potential for abuse associated with THC. Animal and small-scale human studies have demonstrated CBD's anxiolytic, antidepressant, panicolytic, and anticompulsive actions, however more research is needed to investigate the mechanisms of action and determine whether these products represent a safe and effective option for the treatment of anxiety. This study will examine the safety and test the preliminary efficacy of hemp-derived CBD product for improving anxiety symptoms and sleep disturbances among individuals with anxiety.

However, for more and more people eating habits and the question of food choice are of increasing interest and in several cases even a problem. The prevalence of obesity has tripled in the last decades and it is even spoken of an obesity epidemic. Life style interventions to lose weight often fail on the long run, also because people fall back into former unhealthy eating habits. Bariatric surgery is a very effective procedure to reduce weight fundamentally.

Various factors influence our daily food choice, not all of which are apparent to ourselves. Thus, food choice might be goal-directed and therefore conscious and reflective, yet in other circumstances the choice to eat something specific might be based on cue dependent processes which are automatic and thus difficult to control.

Word learning is one of the principal weaknesses in these children. This project focuses on the word learning abilities of four- and five-year-old children with DLD. The goal of the project is to build on the investigators' previous work to determine whether, as has been found thus far, special benefits accrue when these children must frequently recall newly introduced words during the course of learning. The focus of the current study is verb-learning. The goal of the study is to increase children's absolute levels of verb learning while maintaining the advantage that repeated retrieval holds over comparison methods of learning.","Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) affects language learning in an estimated 7% of children. Although much of the research literature has emphasized difficulties learning grammar, children with DLD also have major deficits in vocabulary. In recent work, the investigators have been examining the benefit of retrieval practice to enhance word learning and retention in preschoolers with DLD. The rationale behind this work is grounded in the growing literature in the field of cognitive psychology which shows that repeated practice in retrieving information results in greater long-term retention than continuous study of that information without opportunities for retrieval. In addition, retrieval practice that occurs after a delay-or ""spacing"" between study of a word and subsequent recall attempts-can lead to stronger effects.

The investigators have explored the benefits of retrieval practice for preschoolers with DLD and with typical language development (TD), showing that recall and retention for novel words (nouns, adjectives, verbs) were greater when learned using repeated spaced retrieval (RSR) than when learned using repeated study only. Despite benefitting from RSR, children with DLD still showed lower levels of recall than children with TD, in particular in novel verb learning.

In the current study, the investigators seek to improve the absolute levels of word form recall for verbs by modifying the method used previously. Sixteen children with DLD will be recruited for this study along with 16 children with TD matched on chronological age. Using a within-subjects design, children will learn eight novel verbs, four at a time. Each set of four will be learned over two consecutive days, with two words in the RSR condition and two words in a repeated study condition. The referents for these novel words will be video-recorded transitive actions performed by actors on objects and presented on a laptop screen.

In the RSR condition, children will initially hear the word paired with a video of a novel action, immediately be asked to recall the word, and then see/hear it again. After three other words are presented, they will be asked to recall the original word again; this ""3"" spaced retrieval schedule will continue for the rest of the learning session. In the comparison condition, children will simply hear the words paired with a video of the novel action. In this study, during retrieval practice, children will be prompted to respond with a full sentence containing the verb.

Recall of the verbs will be tested after the learning session on the second day and one week later. At one week, children will also complete a syntactic generalization test in which they are prompted to use the novel verb in a type of sentence that is different from the one used during learning. Finally, children will complete a two-alternative recognition test.

The investigators hypothesize that novel verbs that undergo RSR during the learning period will be learned and recalled better than comparable novel verbs that are assigned to the repeated study condition. This RSR advantage will continue to be observed when the children must use the novel verbs with new actors and objects and will be seen as well in the syntactic generalization test when the children must use the novel verbs in a new sentence frame. Introducing novel verbs representing actions that can be performed on varying objects is expected to improve overall learning. In addition, by having the child produce the verbs in the context of a full sentence, the newly learned verbs should become more integrated with other sentence elements (subjects and direct objects), resulting in a richer representation in memory and consequently, greater recall, recognition, and syntactic flexibility than was observed in the previous novel verb study.",Purdue University,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,31.0,NON_RANDOMIZED,FACTORIAL,Within-participant design in which each child learns words under two conditions.,BASIC_SCIENCE,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

The investigators aim to prophylactically clip all colonic diverticula in patients who have experienced at least 1 episode of diverticular bleeding requiring hospitalization, but without definitive procedure (i.e., total colectomy or localization with embolization or clipping). The investigators' objective is to prevent future episodes of colonic bleeding from the diverticula, so as to avoid morbidity and possible mortality.

The investigators hypothesize that those patients undergoing secondary prophylaxis through diverticular clipping will experience no further episodes of diverticular bleeding.

2.0 OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE

Diverticular bleeding is the most common cause of acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) in Western populations. Although self-limited in 85% of cases, some patients may require hospitalization with blood transfusion and emergent intervention, with significant associated morbidity and mortality. Up to 25% of patients with an initial bleeding episode will have subsequent episodes.

Diverticula form at weak points along the colon wall, where the vasa recta enter the circular muscle layer of the colon. Diverticular bleeding is attributed to thinning of the blood vessels as they cross over the dome of a diverticulum. Endoscopic clipping of actively bleeding colonic diverticula has been recognized as a safe and effective treatment for acute LGIB since the mid-1990s. Patients selected would have had previous colonoscopy to exclude other causes of bleeding (e.g. angiodysplasia, colorectal cancer).

The investigators propose prophylactic elective endoscopic diverticular clipping in patients who have had at least 1 episode of acute LGIB requiring hospitalization. This would involve applying endoscopic clips to the base of every diverticula in a patient's colon, such that any bleeding source would effectively be excluded. The investigators would later re-evaluate patients for colonoscopic appearance of diverticula, as there is some suggestion that diverticula may resolve after such management.

3.0 STUDY DESIGN

The investigators propose a prospective feasibility study of outpatients who have previously been hospitalized with at least one episode of diverticular bleeding. Diverticular disease will have been confirmed by previous colonoscopy to assess the extent of diverticular disease. Consecutive patients at follow-up outpatient appointments will be approached with a Patient Information Sheet. On follow-up appointment they will be recruited and enrolled for endoscopic clipping of colonic diverticula.

The procedure itself will be similar to a screening colonoscopy. As outpatients, patients will take bowel preparation. Colonoscopy will occur with sedation only, including fentanyl and midazolam per protocol. Individual colonic diverticula will be clipped to exclude the bleeding source.

Twenty-four (24) patients will be enrolled for diverticular clipping. These patients will be followed prospectively for 2 years for repeat bleeding episodes. Follow-up will consist of telephone calls every 6 months by the study team. In addition, patients will be scheduled for repeat colonoscopy to assess their diverticular disease 6 months after clipping of colonic diverticula.

4.0 SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS Currently, patients admitted with complications of diverticular disease are seen in Diverticular Disease clinic for follow-up. Consecutive patients will be selected from this patient population.

Patients may withdrawal from the study at any time, including during the colonoscopy with clipping of diverticula.

5.0 DATA COLLECTION AND MONITORING

Data collection will take place on a specially created case report form (See case report form version 1.2). Case report forms will be stored in a locked office in the Department of Colorectal Surgery accessible only to the study team. Data will be entered into an excel spreadsheet. The spreadsheet will be kept on a password protected NHS desktop in a locked office in the Department of Colorectal Surgery.

High-risk large B-cell lymphoma is a type of cancer of the immune system that is usually fast-growing in the body. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, may block cancer growth in different ways by targeting certain cells. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, use substances made from living organisms that may stimulate or suppress the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as etoposide, prednisone, vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving rituximab, ibrutinib, and lenalidomide with combination chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

c6ab91c28d4c7dc8,NCT04855422,Assessing Benchmarks For Allosure And Allomap Testing in Simultaneous Kidney & Pancreas Transplant Recipients.,Assessing Benchmarks For Allosure And Allomap Testing in Simultaneous Kidney & Pancreas Transplant Recipients.,SPKCareDx,2021-12823,"This is a non-randomized, non-interventional, prospective pilot cohort study to monitor SPK patients post-transplant to determine if non-invasive measures using dd-cfDNA (Allosure) and AlloMap can assess an array of immune panels to predict and confirm the development of allograft injury and rejection in either organ.

Aims of the study

1. To develop and validate AlloSure and AlloMap in SPK transplant recipients with stable allograft function and in diagnosis of acute TCMR and ABMR in either organ
2. To assess the ability of AlloSure and AlloMap to determine early discordant rejection in SPK recipients
3. To investigate AlloSure and AlloMap in SPK transplant recipients with diagnosis of BKV viremia","Currently, one the challenges of durable glucose management after pancreas transplantation is the ability to accurately and expediently diagnose early rejection to prevent unnecessary damage to the graft. This assessment is further complicated in combined organ transplantation. Simultaneous pancreas and kidney (SPK) transplantation accounts for most of the utilized pancreas grafts. However, both grafted systems (kidney and pancreas) are not subject to equal immunologic pressures even though they are theoretically presented with similar environments. Historically, the diagnosis of pancreatic rejection was assumed to be tethered to the presence of concomitant kidney rejection. The two organs were believed to reject in tandem. As such, many centers use sentinel biopsy of the kidney to determine rejection in the one or both organs. More recently, many studies have called into question this management strategy as there appears to be increasing evidence that both organs can reject independently of one another.

The presence of two organs allows for many combinations of rejection: both organs may undergo acute rejection known as concordant rejection or one organ may undergo acute rejection independently of the other organ known as discordant rejection. Kidney or pancreas rejection may occur in any time frame after SPK and can greatly affect graft survival. In order to clinically determine rejection in SPK recipients we monitor serum amylase, lipase, glucose, creatinine and proteinuria. Abnormalities in these labs in conjunction with clinical changes often are the indication for biopsy to determine the presence of rejection. More importantly, histology dictates treatment regimen and course. Invariably, SPK recipients sometimes present with normal creatinine and renal function, but with abnormal pancreatic enzymes. In most cases, the kidney biopsy would precede any discussion of pancreas biopsy due to the aforementioned notion of concordant rejection between organs. Certainly, biopsy proven rejection in the kidney with pancreatic enzymatic leak would necessitate aggressive anti-rejection therapy given the high likelihood of pancreatic involvement. However, many times these renal biopsies would be normal and lead to a quandary of how vigorously to pursue further evaluation of the pancreas.

Pancreas graft biopsy is not a common practice, but has been reported to be performed percutaneously, transcystoscopically if the pancreas was anastomosed to bladder, endoscopically, and laparoscopically in a few small series. Most centers use Interventional Radiology for CT guided pancreas biopsy. More importantly, there have been reported cases of complications for pancreas biopsies, mainly stemming from intraabdominal bleeding requiring surgical intervention \[1\]. In an effort to reduce potential patient morbidity from pancreatic biopsy, non-invasive tools like AlloSure that assesses donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) and AlloMap; a gene expression-profiling test may provide an attractive alternative.

Currently dd-cfDNA analysis (AlloSure, CareDx®) in the kidney has shown promise. While the gold standard at present remains histologic assessment of kidney tissue, this may be changing as acceptance of dd-cfDNA grows. Dd-cfDNA analysis is advantageous as it is a noninvasive, less costly, and a potentially safer way to assess allograft rejection. Additionally, the easier accessibility of testing dd-cfDNA can enable more frequent testing, which can elucidate a more accurate progression of rejection rather than a biopsy which is only a snapshot in time. For renal analysis the recommended dd-cfDNA cutoff value is 1.0% to diagnose active rejection (positive and negative predictive values are 61% and 84%). While it seems reasonable that discordant rejection may apply to similar levels of dd-cfDNA seen in kidney alone rejection, concordant rejection levels of dd-cfDNA are unclear.

Notably, the technology behind Allosure has provided several insights into cellular injury from a variety of milieu. In the study by Shen et al., the dd-cfDNA level in deceased donors (44.99%) was significantly higher than that in the living donors (10.24%) at initial time, P \< 0.01. Dd-cfDNA level in delayed graft function (DGF) recipients was lower (23.96%) than that in non-DGF (47.74%) at the initial time, P = 0.89 (19.34% in DGF and 4.46% in non-DGF on the first day, P = 0.17). There was a significant correlation between dd-cfDNA level at initial time and serum creatinine (r2 = 0.219, P = 0.032) and warm ischemia time (r2 = 0.204, P = 0.040). DGF patients experienced a slower decline than non-DGF patients, but both groups had a rapid decline in dd-cfDNA post-transplant.

However, most importantly it appears that a recurrence of dd-cfDNA level may be indicative of active rejection \[5\]. In the case report by Hurkmans et al., it was shown that dd-cfDNA was a sensitive biomarker to detect rejection in solid organ transplantation in a renal transplant patient diagnosed with melanoma and taking nivolumab as treatment. Additionally, the utility of Dd-cfDNA has been studied in the pediatric renal transplant population. In the study by Puliyanda et al., biopsies were completed when dd-cfDNA \> 1.0% or when there was high clinical suspicion. 19 of 67 patients had dd-cfDNA testing as part of routine monitoring with a median dd-cfDNA score of 0.37 (IQR: 0.19-1.10). 48 of 67 patients who had clinical suspicion of rejection had median dd-cfDNA score of 0.47 (0.24-2.15). DSA-positive recipients had higher dd-cfDNA scores than those who were negative or had AT1R positivity alone (P = .003). There was no association between dd-cfDNA score and strength of DSA positivity. 7 of 48 recipients had a biopsy with a dd-cfDNA score \<1%; two showed evidence of rejection. Neither DSA nor AT1R positivity was statistically associated with biopsy-proven rejection. However, dd-cfDNA \>1% was diagnostic of rejection with sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 100% (AUC: 0.996, 0.98-1.00; P = .002). In the study by Sigdal et al., urinary dd-cfDNA after kidney transplantation correlates to the apoptotic injury load of the donor organ. Serial monitoring of urinary dd-cfDNA has been shown to be a sensitive proxy and biomarker of acute injury in the donor organ, but fails to have specificity to differentiate between acute rejection and BK virus nephropathy. Therefore, dd-cfDNA is an appropriate and accurate method in lieu of a biopsy to assess allograft rejection and injury. However, one of the limitations of dd-cfDNA is its ability to be detected is inhibited by methylprednisolone.

In addition to dd-cDNA, the quantification of select genes in circulating leukocytes (AlloMap, CareDx®) has potential to determine rejection. AlloMap has been shown to determine the risk for rejection in Cardiac Allograft Rejection Gene Expression Observational Trial (CARGO) and in the subsequent trial known as CARGO II. The current research of AlloMap in multi-organ recipients reflects a national cohort of 18 heart-kidney, 8 heart-liver, 1 heart-lung matched to 54 heart only recipients. AlloMap Heart® is a panel assay of 20 genes, 11 informative and 9 used for normalization and/or quality control, which produces gene expression data used in the calculation of an AlloMap Heart test score - an integer ranging from 0 to 40. Compared with patients in the same post-transplant period, the lower the score, the lower the probability of acute cellular rejection at the time of testing. Recently a multivariable gene-expression signature targeting T-cell-mediated rejection in peripheral blood of kidney transplant recipients was developed. This frugal TCMR-signature was made of (IFNG, IP-10, ITGA4, MARCH8, RORc, SEMA7A, WDR40A).

The gene expression profiles in renal transplant recipients with BKV viremia have been investigated by microarrays. This research analyzed entire blood gene expression profiles of 19 BKV viremia patients matched to 14 patients without BKV viremia and showed a significant higher expression of GRIT, CAT, and NK cell associated transcript. The study results indicated increased activity of cytotoxic T cells and NK cells in both BKV viremia and nephropathy that resembled acute rejection and showed potential involvement of both the innate and adaptive immune system. This study documents to the importance of studying BKV viremia to exclude the diagnosis due to similar gene expression pattern in blood compared to rejection. In other study, gene expression profiles of DSA+ renal transplant recipients were analyzed with and without tissue findings of ABMR and found that DSA+ patients with ABMR has increased expression of activation, regulation, and differentiation of immune cells (T cells, NK cells, leukocytes, and interleukins).

Allosure and Allomap tests were not studied in SPK recipients in detail. Cutoff values for Allosure test could be different in stable SPK recipients compared to kidney transplant recipients due to additional donor tissue (pancreas and duodenum). It is also unknown, what would be the Allosure values in pancreas and/or kidney rejection in SPK recipients. It is also unknow the circulating gene transcripts in SPK recipients with rejection. Using the similar concept of peripheral blood gene expression by Allomap testing, AlloMap Kidney/Pancreas could be created.",Montefiore Medical Center,OTHER,SPONSOR,OBSERVATIONAL,False,ESTIMATED,50.0,,,,,COHORT,PROSPECTIVE,,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host immune response to infection, and it is a common critical condition in the ICU. Early and timely fluid resuscitation is the cornerstone of sepsis treatment. However, excessive fluid loading can lead to interstitial edema and iatrogenic organ damage, particularly acute kidney injury (AKI). The VExUS grading system is a recently developed system that measures venous congestion through bedside ultrasound by assessing the blood flow waveforms of the portal vein, hepatic vein, and intrarenal veins, as well as the diameter of the inferior vena cava. Similarly, CVP is a commonly used indicator of venous congestion. The objective of this study is to Investigate the association between Venous Excess Ultrasound Score (VExUS), Central Venous Pressure (CVP) during the first three days of ICU admission, and the composite clinical outcome of major adverse kidney events within 30 days (MAKE 30) in sepsis participants.

The study will evaluate use modifications to existing techniques in vein graft handling during harvests. A secondary aim is to develop a standardized approach for harvesting, handling, and preparing vein grafts in the endoscopic approach.","Available data supports two facts: 1) Saphenous vein graft failure rates may be as high as 47% per patient at one year post coronary artery bypass grafting, and 2) Endoscopic vein-graft harvesting is independently associated with vein-graft failure and adverse clinical outcomes.

Multiple factors may contribute to the lower long term patency rates of endoscopically harvested grafts. Summarized, the two major contributing factors are theorized to be harvesting techniques and vein trauma during harvesting.

With recognized disadvantages of open vessel harvesting including higher incidence of infection, longer incisions, greater potential for poor healing, and longer length of hospital stay, reducing the failure rate of vein grafts harvested endoscopically is of utmost importance.

It is our hypothesis that modification of existing harvesting techniques can improve vein graft patency in endoscopic vein graft harvesting so that patency rates comparable to open vessel harvesting can be obtained.

In this prospective, multi-center non-randomized, observational study, 100 patients will undergo routine coronary artery bypass grafting. Eligible candidates will undergo lone coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures with endoscopic vein graft harvesting using best harvesting practices.

Ultrasound (US) guided serratus posterior superior block (SPSPB) is a new interfacial plane block defined by Tulgar et al in 2023. It is based on injection on the serratus posterior superior muscle at the level of the 2nd or 3rd rib. This block provides analgesia in conditions such as interscapular pain, chronic myofascial pain syndromes, scapulocostal syndrome, and shoulder pain. The SPS muscle is located at the C7-T2 level. It attaches to the lateral edges of the second and fifth ribs. It is innervated by the lower cervical and upper intercostal nerves. With the SPS block, these nerves are blocked and analgesia is provided.","Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has started to be considered the standard surgical procedure for lung surgery in recent years. The advantages of VATS compared to open thoracotomy are rapid recovery, shorter hospital stays, and low risk of complications. Although it is a less painful surgical procedure compared to thoracotomy, severe acute postoperative pain can be observed especially in the first hours after VATS. Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA), which is the gold standard for post-thoracotomy analgesia, is used in analgesia after VATS. However, due to the difference in surgical technique and trauma between open surgery and VATS, what should be the gold standard for analgesia after VATS is a matter of debate. It is supported that less invasive analgesic techniques should be applied for minimally invasive surgical procedures, especially due to the difficulty of applying TEA and its side-effect profile. Thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) is considered the first-line regional technique for VATS surgery. However, it is difficult to apply due to its anatomical proximity to important structures such as the pleura and central neuraxial system, and it may cause complications such as pneumothorax and vascular injury. Analgesia management is very important in these patients, as insufficient analgesia in the postoperative period may cause pulmonary complications such as atelectasis, pneumonia, and increased oxygen consumption.

Ultrasound (US) guided serratus posterior superior block (SPSPB) is a new interfacial plane block defined by Tulgar et al in 2023. It is based on injection on the serratus posterior superior muscle at the level of the 2nd or 3rd rib. This block provides analgesia in conditions such as interscapular pain, chronic myofascial pain syndromes, scapulocostal syndrome, and shoulder pain. The SPS muscle is located at the C7-T2 level. It attaches to the lateral edges of the second and fifth ribs. It is innervated by the lower cervical and upper intercostal nerves. With the SPS block, these nerves are blocked and analgesia is provided.

In the cadaveric study of Tulgar et al., it was determined that the spread of serratus posterior superior interfacial plane block; 7-10 intercostal levels on the left side only in the superficial fascia of the trapezius muscle. Spread dye was observed at intercostal levels, absent on the right. There was prominent staining on both sides of the deep trapezius muscle. Both the surface and skin of the rhomboid major were stained, while the rhomboid minor was only stained in the skin. SPSP block will provide successful analgesia in procedures involving the thoracic region such as chronic myofascial pain, breast surgery, thoracic surgery, and shoulder surgery. There is no randomized study in the literature evaluating the effectiveness of SPSP block for postoperative analgesia management after VATS.

In this study, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of US-guided SPSP block for postoperative analgesia management after VATS.

A segment of a biopsy performed as standard-of-care for indications, or by center protocol, will be used for gene expression study.","The current standard for biopsy-based diagnoses of dysfunction of liver transplants is histology (the Banff system), an arbitrary international empirical consensus based on lesions and rules, similar in principle to the kidney, heart, and lung histology systems. Recent data-driven approaches using molecular and conventional technologies indicate that such systems frequently produce incorrect diagnoses - perhaps 40-50% in abnormal kidney or heart transplant biopsies and even more in lung biopsies, with great potential for harm to patients due to inappropriate treatment.

To address this unmet need and improve diagnostics in the area of organ transplantation, the Alberta Transplant Applied Genomics Centre (ATAGC, University of Alberta) has developed a new diagnostic system - the Molecular Microscope® Diagnostic System (MMDx) that interprets biopsies in terms of their molecular phenotype, and combines the molecular and histopathological features of transplant biopsies, plus clinical and laboratory parameters, to create the first Integrated Diagnostic System. The MMDx, developed first in kidney transplant biopsies because phenotypes are well established, will now be adapted to liver transplant biopsies. The present study will develop a Reference Set of liver biopsies, adapt the MMDx system to assess and report molecular phenotype of liver biopsies; and validate and refine this system in 300 unselected prospectively collected for clinical indications and a standard of care biopsies from North American and European Centers.

However, most patients develop recurrences despite surgery. Circulating and disseminated tumor cell (CTC/DTC) and circulating cell-free (cf) DNA isolation from the blood, urine and bone marrow will increase understanding of cancer spread and advance knowledge to develop individualized therapies. These liquid biomarkers might also be suitable for screening purposes and early detection of in high risk subjects for lung cancer.

Hypothesis and Rationale: CTCs/DTCs and cfDNA isolated from the blood, urine and bone marrow undergo pheno- and/or genotype changes. CTCs/DTCs have potential for dissemination and tumor growth in vivo. Investigating the biology of liquid biomarkers in the blood, urine and bone marrow will significantly increase understanding of cancer biology of early and advanced stages.

Specific Aims: CTCs/DTCs and cfDNA will be quantified and characterized for genetic alterations and expression of key signaling/proliferation biomarkers and grow in vivo in nude mice.

Study Design: 100 cancer patients will be recruited for CTC/DTC/cfDNA isolation from the blood, urine and bone marrow with innovative techniques. Bone marrow will be drawn only perioperatively in cancer patients undergoing anesthesia for surgery. 200 high-risk individuals undergoing lung cancer screening with a low dose CT will also be included for blood and urine collection to test the usefulness of these liquid biomarkers for early detection of lung cancer.

d7356859a39a5280,NCT06274151,Optimal Treatment of Acute Skeletal Muscle Injury,Optimal Treatment of Inflammation Following Acute Skeletal Muscle Injury,,H-22038917,"Acute muscle strain injuries occur both during sports, in leisure time activities and during manual occupation and represent a major clinical challenge and has societal economic costs. The recovery time is long and a substantial injury recurrence is observed. Despite current best evidence rehabilitation with early mechanical loading, a significant loss of muscle mass, fatty infiltration and formation of scar tissue is reported.

Animal models and human in vitro experiments suggest that inflammation is vital in the early period after an injury, however an inhibition of inflammatory processes is beneficial for healing.

We investigate here whether a pharmacological inhibition of inflammatory pathways in the 2nd week following a muscle strain injury will provide a better clinical outcome and an advantageous cellular profile than rehabilitative training alone would.","Injuries in skeletal muscle occur in sports, under recreational activities and during manual occupational work, and it represents both a significant clinical challenge and a burden for the individual in the form of long-term functional disability and pain, and for society causing a major economic cost (Ekstrand 2011). Traumatic muscle strain injuries occur most often in the hamstring and the calf region, are caused by high-force movements and most often result in a partial defect at the muscle-tendon (aponeurosis) interface (Tidball 1993, 2017). A major clinical challenge is that the recovery after a traumatic muscle strain injury is often long and in addition to this, substantial injury recurrence is observed. Several studies estimate that 80% of re-injuries occur at the site of the original injury (Wangensteen 2016).

It is known that early mechanical loading is important for shortening the period until pain-free return-to-sport (Bayer 2017). Whereas that study supports the role for mechanical loading in tissue repair and clinical recovery in the form of pain-free return to sports, early loading did not prevent muscle strength reduction and a significant loss of muscle mass in the injured muscle group, indicating that the recovery of the injured region is incomplete (Bayer 2018).

Experimental muscle injury precipitates an inflammatory response in the damaged tissue, which includes sequential infiltration of many cells and the release of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors (Chazaud 2016). Further, a study with human muscle cells and tissue after experimentally induced muscle injury found that a pro-inflammatory phase characterized by M1-macrophages was obligatory needed in the first 7 days after injury in order to initiate the healing process, manifested as proliferation capacity of the myogenic precursor cells (MPC) (Saclier 2013). It can be argued thus that a blockade of this proinflammatory phase would inhibit the healing process. In contrast, to advance the healing process after this initial pro-inflammatory phase, a switch to more anti-inflammatory activity - M2-macrophage activity - was needed in the later phase (7-14 days) to ensure differentiation of the MPC and thus a continued regeneration of tissue (Saclier2013). It is therefore possible that this anti-inflammatory stage is vital and that continued inflammation would cause an overall suboptimal healing response. Recently, a long-lasting inflammatory response after a muscle strain injury was reported. Based on analysis of injury exudates, very high levels of several pro-inflammatory factors were observed (Bayer 2019). Persistent presence of inflammation is linked to the development of fibrotic tissue changes in the long run (Wynn 2016) and importantly, fibrotic changes have been described following strain injuries (Bayer 2021, Silder 2008). Also, as prolonged elevated TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-α) is known as an activator of the Nuclear Factor NF-κB pathway, this could cause stimulation of muscle atrophy related genes (Cohen 2015). It appears therefore clinically relevant to ensure that the pro-inflammatory phase following strain injuries is initially undisturbed, but the continuous pro-inflammatory phase is blunted to reduce the formation of fibrosis.

The aim of the present study is to test the hypothesis that an inhibition of inflammation, combined with the best standard training regimen in the later phase of recovery after injury (day 7-14) will provide a more optimal tissue recovery after injury than training alone will do.

The overall hypothesis is that administration of NSAID in the second week after an acute muscle strain injury in otherwise healthy humans, will be beneficial for tissue healing, characterized by an improved cellular composition allowing for less scar formation in the regeneration phase.

Participants will undergo a basic physical examination, including ultrasonographic scanning of the injured muscle site and fulfill questionnaire regarding previous injury history and present activities as well as symptoms.

Participants are then randomized to either placebo or NSAID treatment (Bonyl/ Naproxen 500 mg x 2 per day for 7 days) starting on day 7 and continued until day 14 post injury.

When participants are free of pain during movement including repeated explosive movements, the duration of the injury onset until full recovery is recorded (time to return to sports). Each participant will be followed by questionnaires for one year to record potential re-injuries.

Biopsies will be taken in week 1 post injury, before the pharmacological intervention, and in week 3 post injury, after the pharmacological intervention.

Biopsies will be analyzed by single nuclei RNA sequencing. Bioinformatics will be applied to investigate the distribution and number of cells in the injured muscle. Each biopsy will be compared to the control muscle (the same muscle as the injured one on the healthy, contralateral leg).

The main goal is to find out if weSIPsmarter helps reduce sugary drink consumption in preschool-aged children and their parents.","Sugary drinks are the largest single source of calories in the US diet and contribute approximately 8% and 7% of total energy intake for US youth and adults, respectively. Unfortunately, the prevalence of daily sugary drink intake is significantly higher in nonmetropolitan US counties, relative to metropolitan counties (adjusted prevalence ratio = 1.32). Also, an estimated 47% of children age 2-5 consume sugary drinks daily. High sugary drink intake contributes to the development of numerous chronic conditions, including cancer. Despite convincing data on risky sugary drink behaviors in rural counties and among preschool-aged children, there are substantial gaps in the intervention literature. For example, few sugary drink interventions have targeted the needs of US rural regions, few have effectively used scalable technology to reduce child's sugary drinks, and most fail to report on external validity factors. This research addresses these needs and builds on the research team's extensive digital Health expertise and successful sugary drink research within rural communities. Head Starts across defined rural areas (i.e., RUCC 4-9) in Appalachia and the southern Black Belt will be included. The intervention targets parents as the agent of change and aims to improve parent-child dyad outcomes. Phase 1 is guided by the Adaptome framework. In partnership with rural Head Start staff and parents, a user-centered design process will be applied to adapt an existing evidence-based sugary drink interventions to a digital intervention. This new program, called weSIPsmarter, will be a highly interactive, structured program consisting of multiple evidence-based behavioral change components, including use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to encourage self-monitoring of beverage behaviors and parenting feeding practices, action planning, a resource help line, and drinking water vouchers for families with concerns related to in-home tap water quality. Phase 2 is guided by RE-AIM and includes a 2 group cluster RCT design \[weSIPsmarter vs. control\] with 3 assessment (pre, 9-week post, and 12-month follow-up) periods. Twelve Head Start center clusters with an average of 31 parent-child dyads per cluster (total of 372 parent-child dyads) will be randomized. It is hypothesized that weSIPsmarter will be more efficacious at reducing sugary drink consumption than control. Changes in secondary outcomes will also be evaluated, including parent-child dyad outcomes (e.g., diet quality, water, BMI, QOL, behavioral theory constructs) and maintenance at 12-months post intervention. Additional secondary aims will examine reach, describe parent engagement, and apply a mixed-methods process evaluation to evaluate adoption and implementation among Head Starts. Mediators and moderators (e.g., social determinant of health indicators) to engagement and efficacy outcomes will be explored, along with organizational-level maintenance.

However, some patients continue to experience persistent diabetic macular edema and poor vision despite continued laser and/or anti-vegf therapy. Recent clinical trials suggest that due to inflammatory mediators dexamethasone intravitreal implant (0.7mg) may be a good alternative therapy for individuals unresponsive to laser photocoagulation or intravitreal anti-vascular growth factor injections. The purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of using a dexamethasone steroid implant versus monthly intravitreal anti-VEGF injections for research participants with persistent diabetic macular edema (DME).","Macular edema is a major cause of central vision loss in patients presenting with diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic macular edema (DME) occurs when fluid leaks into the center of the macula, the part of the eye where sharp, straight-ahead vision occurs. The fluid makes the macula swell, blurring vision. Diabetic macular edema (DME) affects between 8% to 10% of 23.6 million diabetic individuals in the United States. The prevalence of diabetic macular edema after 15 years of known diabetes is approximately 20% in patients with type 1 diabetes, 25% in patients with type 2 diabetes who are taking insulin, and 14% in patients with type 2 diabetes who do not take insulin. Within two years of diagnosis, nearly half of individuals with DME will lose 2 or more lines of visual acuity (the smallest line you can read on a standardized vision chart held 20 feet away).

Diabetic macular edema is typically treated with laser and/or intravitreal injections of drugs such as anti-VEGF agents. Anti-VEGF agents block a protein that slows the growth of the abnormal blood vessels. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid used to treat inflammation. Dexamethasone implant is a steroid implant injected into the eye to treat swelling that may occur when there is a blockage of certain blood vessels in your eyes. Both anti-VEGF agents and dexamethasone implant are approved by the FDA to treat DME.

The purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of using a dexamethasone steroid implant versus monthly intravitreal anti-VEGF injections for research participants with persistent diabetic macular edema (DME).",California Retina Consultants,OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,40.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,TREATMENT,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

It is often viewed as an invasive procedure with the potential for embarrassment, discomfort, and worry. Such fears can result in anxiety that may decrease the tolerance and cooperation of the patient, limit the success of the procedure, and increase the likelihood of complications. Therefore, colonoscopy is frequently performed under sedation. The anxiety level of the patient before the procedure may increase the requirement for sedation. It is important for the anesthesiologist to predict the effective dosages of sedation before the procedure to ensure rapid and comfortable sedation as well as prompt recovery and discharge of the patient.

This prospective cohort study is planned to evaluate the effects of pre-procedural anxiety level on the dose of propofol needed for patient and surgeon satisfaction during colonoscopy.","Patients scheduled for elective colonoscopy for screening are enrolled. On the day of the procedure, demographic data are collected and all patients are asked to complete the Spielberger State-trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-I and STAI-II) in an isolated, calm room before being transferred to the procedure room.

All patients are monitored with electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure and bispectral index measurement at 5-min intervals.

Oxygen is administered at 4 L/min via a face mask, Propofol 2% infusion is started via an effect-site target controlled infusion system (Marsh model).

Once the patient reaches the desired level of sedation as determined by BIS value of 60, the procedure is started.

This monitorization and sedation protocol is the routine management of outpatient colonoscopies and gastroscopies in our institution.

For this study the patients' anxiety levels are evaluated with the STAI score. This is not an intervention but an evaluation of the patients. Drug dosing or sedation management are not adjusted according to the anxiety scores but are calculated with the patients' weight.

During the procedure:

* hemodynamic parameters
* the total propofol dosage
* the number of TCI interventions
* complications (respiratory depression, need for ventilation, nausea, vomiting, laryngospasm, and agitation)
* the procedure duration

Diagnosing AOM can be challenging, as ear symptoms and eardrum appearances often overlap with mild or transient conditions. This uncertainty may lead to both unnecessary antibiotic use and missed cases requiring treatment, affecting patient safety and contributing to antibiotic resistance.

This study evaluates two digital tools designed to support more accurate diagnosis and treatment decisions in primary care:

1. AOM Dx \[diagnosis\] Trainer (Otitspelet) - a gamified digital training program for physicians that provides interactive exercises using eardrum images and patient cases, with direct feedback to improve diagnostic accuracy and adherence to guidelines.
2. AI-based diagnostic support - a system that analyses tympanic membrane images, with and without symptom and tympanometry data, to evaluate its potential for future diagnostic use.

The trial is coordinated by the Västra Götaland Region (VGR) in collaboration with Umeå University and conducted across four Swedish regions: Västra Götaland, Västerbotten, Östergötland, and Skåne. VGR leads the evaluation of the AOM Dx Trainer intervention, while Umeå University leads the AI development and retrospective diagnostic analyses. The study is carried out as a multicentre, cluster-randomised controlled trial in primary care, where participating primary care centres are randomised to either the training intervention or standard care.

Physicians are the research participants under evaluation. At intervention centres, physicians complete training with the AOM Diagnosis (Dx) Trainer before study start; at control centres, no training is provided. Each participating centre then conducts an 8-week observation period, during which physicians diagnose and manage patients with new-onset ear symptoms. Patients are included only to allow evaluation of physicians' diagnostic and treatment decisions and to provide data for AI analysis. Estimated patient enrollment is \~200. Depending on centre size and recruitment success, up to 20 primary care centres across four Swedish regions - Västra Götaland, Västerbotten, Östergötland, and Skåne - will participate. After each consultation, research nurses collect tympanic membrane images and tympanometry data from patients who have given informed consent. These data are used for expert panel reference diagnoses and retrospective AI analysis; no information is shared with treating physicians.

The primary outcome is diagnostic accuracy of tympanic membrane assessment by physicians trained with the AOM Dx Trainer compared with untrained physicians, using expert consensus as the reference standard. Secondary outcomes include adherence to treatment guidelines and antibiotic prescribing rates. The AI system's diagnostic performance will also be benchmarked against the expert panel and physician groups.

By combining educational and technological innovation, this study aims to enhance diagnostic precision, improve guideline adherence, and reduce unnecessary antibiotic use in primary care-strengthening antimicrobial stewardship and providing a scalable model for future infection management.","This multicentre, cluster-randomised controlled trial evaluates two digital innovations for improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment quality in acute otitis media (AOM) management in Swedish primary care: a gamified training tool for physicians (AOM Diagnosis \[Dx\] Trainer) and an AI-based diagnostic support system. The study assesses diagnostic accuracy, adherence to evidence-based treatment guidelines, and comparative AI performance.

The trial is coordinated by the Västra Götaland Region (VGR) in collaboration with Umeå University and conducted across four Swedish regions: Västra Götaland, Västerbotten, Östergötland, and Skåne. Up to 20 primary care centres will participate, depending on centre size and recruitment rates. Centres are randomised to either the AOM Dx Trainer intervention or standard care (control).

Study design and participants:

Both physicians and patients are research participants. Physicians in the intervention arm complete the AOM Dx Trainer before patient inclusion begins, while control physicians receive no training. Each centre recruits consecutive patients with new-onset ear symptoms (≤1 month) during an 8-week inclusion period (intervention or control). Consultations are conducted according to standard clinical practice. After each visit, research nurses ensure eligibility and consent and collect tympanic membrane images and tympanometry data solely for research purposes.

Interventions:

The AOM Dx Trainer is a gamified, case-based training tool designed to improve recognition of AOM and related conditions. Physicians classify anonymised tympanic images with symptom vignettes into diagnostic categories and receive immediate feedback. Training continues until a predefined performance threshold is reached.

The AI diagnostic tool, developed at Umeå University, uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyse tympanic images, with or without symptom and tympanometry data. AI analyses will be performed retrospectively in a laboratory setting and will not influence patient care.

Data collection:

After each visit, patients meet a research nurse who ensures eligibility and consent, and records demographics, symptom severity (AOM-SOS v5), and potential complicating factors (e.g., severe pain despite analgesics, immunosuppression, previous ear surgery, cochlear implant). The physician's diagnosis and any antibiotic prescription (drug and duration) are documented for later comparison with guideline recommendations and expert panel consensus. Physician characteristics are recorded under pseudonymised IDs. Tympanic membrane images are captured using CE-marked video otoscopes (EarPenguin) and tympanometry devices. All data are entered into case report forms (CRFs) and stored securely but are not shared with treating physicians, ensuring real-world diagnostic conditions.

Data handling and ethics:

All data are pseudonymised. Code keys are securely stored within each region. The national coordinating centre in Gothenburg oversees data management and quality assurance. Data are stored on GDPR-compliant servers. Ethical approval has been granted by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (Ref. 2025-03523-01).

Expert panel reference diagnoses:

Tympanic images and tympanometry results are reviewed retrospectively by an expert panel (two ENT specialists and one senior GP). Consensus diagnoses serve as the reference standard for assessing diagnostic accuracy among physicians and for benchmarking AI performance.

Primary outcome:

Diagnostic accuracy of tympanic membrane classification (normal, AOM, erythematous membrane without effusion, or otitis media with effusion) compared with expert consensus.

Secondary outcomes:

Adherence to national treatment guidelines; antibiotic prescribing rates and duration; and comparative diagnostic performance between physicians and AI configurations.

Sample size and power:

The sample size calculation targets the primary research question. Using a bivariate logistic regression as a proxy (outcome: correct vs. incorrect diagnosis; predictor: intervention status), unpublished data from our group suggest approximately 50% diagnostic accuracy among physicians without AOM Dx Trainer training. We hypothesize an improvement to around 75% among trained physicians, which is considered a clinically relevant threshold. Assuming a two-sided alpha of 0.05 and 95% power, a minimum of 195 patients is required (G\*Power 3.1.9.7). Therefore, approximately 200 patients will be recruited, with roughly equal numbers in the intervention and control arms. This target aligns with the planned multicentre cluster-randomised design and is feasible within the established Swedish primary care research network.",Vastra Gotaland Region,OTHER_GOV,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,200.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,DIAGNOSTIC,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria Patients:

Ineffectiveness of intervention to instigate behavioral change is largely due to failure to take into account the stage of change in which individuals are. The TTM suggests that decisional balance, which reflects the relative difference between pros and cons, is important for influencing the stage of change. In order to achieve behavioral change, the perceived pros of changing must be strengthened to outweigh the cons. In addition, individual must be self-convinced that the behavioral change is important for themselves. Furthermore, the process for behavioral change can be provided to facilitate behavioral change in individuals.

1. To create an automatic notification system to prompt physicians of test results finalized after discharge.
2. To evaluate the impact of this system on physician awareness of test results finalized after discharge.

Hypothesis: Automatic email notification will improve physician awareness of test results finalized after discharge compared to usual care.

Specific Aims: (Study #2, funded by CRICO, completed July 2012)

1. To identify a cohort of discharged patients with potentially actionable results of tests pending at discharge (TPAD).
2. To determine if automated email notification of the finalized results of potentially actionable TPADs affects the rate of post-discharge actions taken as documented in the electronic medical record (EMR).

Hypothesis: Automated email notification of the finalized results of potentially actionable TPADs increases the rate of actions taken post-discharge.","Failure to follow up on abnormal test results is a critical problem and is more likely to occur in the case of tests that are performed in the hospital but whose results are not available or not finalized until after discharge (i.e., pending test results). Responsible inpatient and ambulatory providers may not be aware of these test results. In a prior study, Roy et al. determined that 41% of patients were discharged before all laboratory, microbiology, and radiology test results were finalized (31% were collectively hematology, chemistry, and pathology tests, 27% were radiology studies, and 42% were microbiology results). Of these results, 9.4% were considered potentially actionable by independent physician review and could have altered the post-discharge patient care plan. Physicians were only aware of 38% of these test results. Failure to follow-up on these test results can lead to delays in diagnosis, missed treatment opportunities, redundant ordering of tests, and subsequent patient harm. In a hospital the size of Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) with 44,000 annual admissions, physicians would be unaware of almost 2000 actionable test results per year. Automated systems can mitigate this problem by ensuring prompt notification of relevant test results finalized after discharge to responsible inpatient and ambulatory providers. Using internal BWH funding, we have developed an automated email notification system to facilitate management of tests pending at discharge (TPADs).

In study 1 (funded by AHRQ), we will prospectively evaluate the impact of this intervention on physician awareness of TPAD results. In study 2 (funded by CRICO), we will perform a chart review to determine the impact of the intervention on downstream actions taken by physicians and acknowledgment of TPAD results as documented in the electronic medical record.",Brigham and Women's Hospital,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,441.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,,,SINGLE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Method: People with PD will be randomized into 3 groups: (1) Face-to-face group, in which participants, in groups of 10 persons, followed a multidisciplinary health education program composed of 10 monthly face-to-face lectures; (2) Remote group, in which individuals followed the same lectures delivered by online; and (3) Control group, in which participants followed no lecture. The participants will be evaluated before (BED) and after (ABP) the education program conclusion (10 lectures). Health quality of life was adopted as a primary outcome. Independence in daily living activities, motor and non-motor symptoms severity, and global cognitive capacity was adopted as secondary measures, Besides, all participants will be asked to answer a survey to evaluate the knowledge improvement of key learning points of lectures. The results will be analyzed by ANOVA for repeated measures.","Parkinson's disease is a large cause of disability worldwide. The complex combination of motor and non-motor symptoms brings an increasing impairment in functionality and, consequently, a progressively decrease in the quality of life of the people living with PD and their families. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that for health care, especially in chronic diseases, care should be centered on the person (people-centered care). This model enlarges the focus on biological aspects, including psychological and social aspects, building a multidimensional perspective on an individual, which can only be reached by integrated and interprofessional care.

According to this model, education is crucial to empower the person to occupy an active role in the health process, gaining greater control over decisions and actions affecting their health. Patient empowerment has been associated with positive health and clinical outcomes, including improved disease management, effective use of health services, improved health status, and medication adherence. However, there are several barriers for participants to attending this kind of program. Reasons for nonparticipation include mobility-reducing physical health issues, time constraints, distance, insufficient funds, lack of respite care if caring for someone else, and transportation. Thus, using a home-based video class may be one opportunity to reduce these known barriers and improve the accessibility of education programs. This delivery strategy can be beneficial for no high-income countries.

Objective: The objective of this study is to compare the effects of two similar long-term interprofessional programs, one of them delivers by in-person classes, and another delivers by online classes on the quality of life of people with Parkinson's.

Method: People with a confirmed diagnosis of Idiopathic Parkinson's disease, in stage 1-4 of disease evolution according to Hoehn and Yahr classification will be randomized into 3 groups: (1) Face-to-face group (FFG), in which participants, in groups of 10 persons, followed a multidisciplinary health education program composed of 10 monthly face-to-face lectures; (2) Remote group (RG), in which individuals followed the same lectures delivered by online; and (3) Control group (CG), in which participants followed no lecture. People who have severe cognitive decline and uncorrected visual or hearing impairment will be excluded. Participants from both groups will be instructed to follow their usual routine for the treatment of the disease. The lectures on the management of motor and non-motor alterations associate with PD will be offered by a nurse, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, speech therapist, neurologist, lawyer, nutritionist, and psychologist. The participants will be evaluated before (BED) and after (ABP) the education program conclusion (10 lectures). Health quality of life, adopted as a primary outcome, will be evaluated by Parkinson´s disease questionnaire 39 (PDQ-39). The independence in daily living activities, motor and non-motor symptoms severity, and global cognitive capacity, adopted as secondary measures, will be evaluated by Unified Parkinson´s disease rating scale (UPDRS) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), respectively. Besides, all participants will be asked to answer a survey to evaluate the knowledge improvement of key learning points of lectures. The survey consisted of 20 questions (2 per lecture) where the minimum level (score 0) indicated the absence of knowledge and maximal level (score 5) indicated the full understanding of lectures' key points. The results will be analyzed by ANOVA for repeated measures considering as factor group (FFG, RG, CG) and assessment points (BED, AEP).",University of Sao Paulo General Hospital,OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,45.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,"Stratified, single-blind, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial",TREATMENT,,,SINGLE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

To date, NPWT was not evaluated in patients undergoing breast conserving surgery without direct reconstruction.Therefore, the aim of this trial is to evaluate the feasibility of NPWT after surgery and its effects on postoperative complications.","Rationale:

Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) could improve surgical outcomes and reduce complications like SSI, wound dehiscence and seroma in closed surgical wounds. Complication rate after breast conserving surgery for breast cancer is 2-17%, surgical site infections (SSI) being the most common. To date, NPWT was not evaluated in patients undergoing breast conserving surgery without direct reconstruction. Therefore, in this trial, the aim is to evaluate the feasibility of NPWT after breast conserving surgery and its effects on postoperative complications.

Objective and study parameters:

Primary objective is to compare surgical site complications in patients with and without NPWT. Secondary objective is to assess the number of re-interventions, unplanned visits and pain scores.

Study design:

A prospective cohort of 150 patients will be compared to a retrospective cohort of 150 patients.

Study population:

Breast cancer patients undergoing breast conserving surgery with or without sentinel lymph node biopsy.

Intervention (if applicable):

Negative pressure wound therapy.

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness:

When participating in this study, patients will need to pay at least one extra visit to the hospital, possibly two if this cannot be combined with the standard postoperative visits. In addition, patients will need to have a device with them for 14 days after surgery. This device is connected to the wound dressing. All wound dressings may cause irritation or an allergic reaction. This risk is not higher than when receiving standard wound dressing, but it is something to take into consideration.

Smectite is a natural silicate clay belonging to the dioctahedral smectite class formed from aluminomagnesium silicate. It is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but binds to intestinal mucous, forms multilayer structure with high plastic viscosity and powerful coating properties hence preserving integrity of the mucus, and has the ability to absorb directly bacterial toxins, bacteria, viruses and bile salts. The current study aim was to conduct placebo-controlled randomize clinical trial for the efficiency of a combination of multiprobiotics with smectite (Symbiter-Forte formulation) as an adjunction to the standard anti-diabetic therapy on IR, glycemic control parameters, β-cells functional activity, anthropometric parameters and markers of a chronic systemic inflammatory response in type 2 diabetes patients.","In this single-center double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study, 55 type 2 diabetes patients from the Kyiv City Clinical Endocrinology Center were selected.

Randomization was done by the study statistician based on a computer-generated list. The groups were homogeneous according to age, sex and diagnostic criteria. The assignment of groups was blind to participants, research staff and outcome assessors moreover, to maintain blind parallel study the statistician was not aware of the allocation of participants to intervention.

Over 8 weeks of interventional period, the patient received 1 sachet (10 grams) of probiotic-smectite and placebo per day. All sachets were identical with similar organoleptic characteristics (e.g., taste and appearance).

The pre-randomization period was designed to minimize the effects of dietary changes on metabolic markers. For this purpose, 2 weeks before the study start, after inform consent signed, patients were instructed in one-on-one sessions with a dietitian to follow a therapeutic lifestyle-change diet as classiﬁed by the NCEP. In addition, participants were instructed to continue with stable anti-hyperglycemic treatment and received standardized mild physical training for 1 hour per day.

VDR Polymorphisms

Polymorphisms in the VDR gene have been identified through out the complete VDR gene region and associated with cancer and autoimmune diseases. The FokI polymorphism is present in the translation site and results in the VDR protein being shortened by three amino acids and is not linked with any other VDR polymorphisms. This polymorphism predisposes to bone-disease, risk of cancer, immune mediated diseases 147-149,150, 151.

The common VDR gene polymorphisms are BsmI, TaqI, ApaI and FokI. These polymorphisms have shown varying results with insulin sensitivity and secretion.","Diabetes Foundation, India",OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,110.0,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,,BASIC_SCIENCE,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

757f957da58cb221,NCT05675631,Effects of Suspension Training in Older Adults,Effects of Suspension Training Versus a Traditional One in the Elderly Population: a Randomized Clinical Trial,,OA_SUSTRAIN,"Traditionally, tools that use unstable surfaces have been used to increase the difficulty of exercises by stimulating the recruitment of a greater number of motor units. A new method is suspension training. It uses the weight of the body and the principles of moments of forces to improve the recruitment of motor units. The difficulty that stimulates this recruitment depends on the amount of instability caused by the suspension apparatus and the position of the body.

So this type of training in the elderly can be very interesting due to the ease of adaptation, since it can be used as a facilitating method or to increase the difficulty.

It seems that suspension training can have positive effects that will have a direct impact on the quality of life of the elderly, due to improvements in different aspects such as gaining strength and improving balance, consequently reducing the risk of falling. . It is a good alternative to gain strength and improve functional mobility and upper trunk strength in the elderly, to other exercises such as elastic bands, since they produce similar effects.

For all these reasons, the program tries to demonstrate that suspension training can be an effective tool to improve the quality of life and reduce the risk of falls in the elderly.","This research originates from the curiosity of wanting to prove that exercise in the elderly is more than recommended, specifically suspension training.

Traditionally, tools that use unstable surfaces have been used to increase the difficulty of exercises by stimulating the recruitment of a greater number of motor units. A new method is suspension training. It uses the weight of the body and the principles of moments of forces to improve the recruitment of motor units. The difficulty that stimulates this recruitment depends on the amount of instability caused by the suspension apparatus and the position of the body.

So this type of training in the elderly can be very interesting due to the ease of adaptation, since it can be used as a facilitating method or to increase the difficulty.

Additionally, an unstable resistance training situation stresses/taxes the neuromuscular system and can promote a greater gain in strength and increase the cross-sectional area. It can also increase motor unit recruitment and improve neuromuscular coordination without an increase in mechanical load when performing push-ups under unstable conditions. Because TRX exercises involve normal resistance, they can potentially improve strength by facilitating the use of large and fast-twitch muscle units, increasing muscle coordination and stimulating the musculoskeletal system, and increasing the number of muscle fibers. Suspension work increases the activation of most muscle groups involved in suspension training (push-ups, inverted row, prone bridge and hamstring curl) compared to traditional training.

Likewise, for the upper extremity it improves significantly as well as training with elastic bands. Improves the handgrip. Due to the constant use of suspension elements. For the lower extremity, a very high activation of the biecps femoris and semitendinosus (\<90% MVIC), hamstrings, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius and adductor lagus have been observed. In relation to balance, it has been observed that suspension training has more notable positive effects on it than in traditional training due to the constant adaptation and participation of the CORE in the different exercises. On the other hand, regarding the fear of falls, it has been observed that, in medium and high intensity programs, this fear decreases as the participants feel more confident. In this type of study, positive effects have also been shown on sleep quality through the PSQI, positive effects on stride after high intensity and positive changes in body composition: higher percentage of water at the cellular level, with which better value of PhA and better cellular health. Finally, another possible advantage is the ease of installation of the material and its affordable price, since traditional training often requires more expensive machines and tools.

It seems then that suspension training can have positive effects that will have a direct impact on the quality of life of the elderly, due to improvements in different aspects such as gaining strength and improving balance, consequently reducing the risk of suffering a drop. It is a good alternative to gain strength and improve functional mobility and upper trunk strength in the elderly, to other exercises such as elastic bands, since they produce similar effects.

8d203270978fbca5,NCT02099331,Cardiac Surgery and the Risk of Atrial Fibrillation: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Melatonin,Cardiac Surgery and the Risk of Atrial Fibrillation: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Melatonin,DREAM,NA_00090647,"Atrial fibrillation is a common heart rhythm condition that can occur after cardiac surgery and has been associated with an increase in hospital length of stay, overall hospital costs, worsening clinical condition and higher rates of death. Newer research indicates that inflammation is a key contributor to atrial fibrillation in this setting.

Melatonin is a naturally made hormone that is regarded as an extremely effective anti-inflammatory substance, with a very favorable safety profile. This clinical trial is being done to test the ability of melatonin to reduce the risk of developing atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery.

This is a research study where patients will be given either oral melatonin at 40 mg or placebo nightly prior to sleep. The study product will start approximately 2 days prior to the scheduled surgery date and will continue until the 3rd day after the operation. The remainder of the clinical care will remain the same.

The investigators project that patients who receive melatonin will have a significant decrease in the occurrence of atrial fibrillation after surgery.","Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia to occur after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. This arrhythmia occurs in approximately 1 in every 3 patients in this setting and the rate is even higher after valve or combined valve and CABG procedures. The majority of episodes of atrial fibrillation occur within the first 3 days after cardiac surgery and for those who have an initial episode of atrial fibrillation, the majority will go on to have another recurrence within 2 days of the first episode. Postoperative atrial fibrillation has been associated with an increase in neurological, renal and infectious complications as well as prolonged hospitalization and a significant increase in overall healthcare costs.

There is a considerable amount of emerging data indicating that inflammation and oxidative stress, by way of reactive oxygen species (ROS), associated with cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) may play an important role in the in the development of postoperative atrial fibrillation. Prior animal studies have demonstrated that ROS may lead to electroanatomical remodeling and increase the vulnerability to atrial fibrillation by promoting progressive fibrosis and subsequent alteration of the extracellular matrix. A few randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of pre-treatment with anti-inflammatory medications such as statins for the prevention of post-operative atrial fibrillation. With this in mind, other anti-inflammatory therapies may also be effective in preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation.

Melatonin (N - acetyl - 5 - methoxytryptamine) is the main product secreted from the pineal gland and has been shown to be a powerful scavenger of ROS and is regarded as the most potent endogenous antioxidant. In fact, melatonin is more effective than other antioxidants in removing free radicals and it has both lipophilic and hydrophilic properties contributing to its more consistent penetration through cellular membranes. In addition to being a naturally synthesized hormone, melatonin has been shown to have a very favorable safety profile when administered in the clinical setting.

For these reasons, investigators have designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial where patients who are to undergo cardiac surgery and CPB, will be randomized to melatonin or placebo and the investigators will determine the incidence of post operative atrial fibrillation in both groups. Additionally, the investigators will measure ROS from serum as well as right atrial appendage samples of subjects and assess the effects of melatonin on ROS levels as compared to placebo.",Johns Hopkins University,OTHER,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ACTUAL,0.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,,PREVENTION,,,TRIPLE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

HCC represents about 90% of primary liver cancers and constitutes a major global health problem.Therapeutic approaches depend on the stage of the disease. In the last decade systemic therapy approaches complement surgical and locoregional treatment in advanced disease stages.

The current first-line drug class used to treat locally advanced and metastasized HCC are tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). At the moment the multikinase inhibitors sorafenib, lenvatinib and regorafenib are licensed in Austria for treatment of HCC: TKIs are a class of small molecule drugs that block the intracellular signals which drive proliferation in many malignant cells by specifically inhibiting the kinase function of individual intracellular pathways involved in receptor-mediated growth signaling.Diarrhea is one of the most common side effects of TKIs, that often prevents optimal dosage and thereby limits efficacy of systemic cancer therapy. Mechanisms of TKI induced diarrhea are largely unknown, speculations span from induction of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency leading to vitamin malabsorption and hypophosphatemia to enterocyte malfunction. Recently, accumulating data suggest that the composition of gut microbiome may also affect efficacy and toxicity of cancer therapy. In a small pilot study (n=25) patients who did not develop diarrhea under TKI had a higher abundance of Butyricimonas and a lower abundance of Citrobacter, Peptostreptococcus, and Staphylococcaceae. To the best of our knowledge, microbiome composition in patients with TKI induced diarrhea has not been studied in detail yet. However, this information is of clinical relevance since the manipulation of the gut microbiota through antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics or fecal transplantation is an interesting strategy to improve efficacy and mitigate toxicity of anticancer drugs such as TKI. Probiotics for example have been shown to be able to prevent and treat diarrhea and may therefore be a valuable option to prevent or treat TKI-induced side effects.

In 2019 around 5000 Austrian citizens were diagnosed with lung cancer. The diagnosis is associated with a very poor prognosis compared to other malignant diseases. However, the introduction of checkpoint inhibitors has led to a revolutionary improvement in prognosis for those that respond.

Immune-Checkpoints are immunologic pathways that are used by tumor cells to evade destruction by immune cells. The most important checkpoints to date are programmed death ligand 1 (PDL-1), cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and TIGIT. Antagonization of these check points by monoclonal antibodys can largely improve antineoplastic efficacy of immune cells.

These immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are essential part of modern neoadjuvant, adjuvant and palliative oncologic therapy concepts. ICI-treatment may lead to remarkable responses. However, 60 to 80 percent of patients do not respond to therapy.Although Tumor-PDL-1 level has shown some predictive value and is therefore used in clinical praxis it cannot predict response reliably.

Many preclinical and clinical trials showed evidence of relevant impact of the composition of the microbiome of the gut and response to ICI. Therefore, the microbiome of the gut may be promising biomarker and even possible target for intervention to predict and improve ICI response in the future. However, the exact optimal composition of the gut microbiome and the strategies for intervention are still unclear.",Medical University of Graz,OTHER,SPONSOR,OBSERVATIONAL,False,ESTIMATED,150.0,,,,,COHORT,PROSPECTIVE,,SAMPLES_WITHOUT_DNA,"serum, plasma, urine, stool","Inclusion Criteria:

Step 1 of the proposed study consists of a telephone survey of the 3282 women with irregular periods and/or ovarian cysts. The survey will be conducted by the MATR. The instrument to be used contains a series of simple and direct questions and will take about 10 minutes to complete. The questions were designed to identify PCOS and their content deals with the frequency of menstrual periods (six or fewer per year being a major diagnostic criterion), a previous diagnosis of PCOS, obesity, excess facial hair and other evidence of hyperandrogenism. The women will also be asked if they have a living twin sister. On the basis of this survey, women will be identified who are likely to have PCOS and have a living female twin.",National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (CC),NIH,,OBSERVATIONAL,,,,,,,,,,,,,"* INCLUSION CRITERIA:

They are used to treat life threatening heart rhythm disorders. They have conventionally consisted of a generator sitting under the skin of the chest and leads which pass from veins in the collar bone region to the heart. Problems with these devices can necessitate extraction, with the commonest reason being infection. If extraction is required for infection then re-implantation is usually deferred for approximately one week whilst antibiotics are given so that the risk of infection of the new device can be minimised. This has considerable implications for healthcare resources. A new ICD has been developed that is entirely subcutaneous with no intravenous element. It is already in clinical use and is positioned remote from conventional ICD sites. With no intravenous element there is very little risk of infection in the blood affecting the new device. It is therefore likely to be possible to re-implant these devices immediately after extracting a conventional system. The aim of this research is to assess the outcome in patients re-implanted with this device immediately after conventional ICD system extraction. This data will be compared compared to those who have conventional systems re-implanted after the necessary delay.",,Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust,OTHER,PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,50.0,NA,SINGLE_GROUP,,TREATMENT,,,NONE,,,"Inclusion Criteria:

Some studies of women who use a hormonal birth control method (specifically oral pills, patches, and injections) and take ARVs have shown that ARVs interact with the hormones released by the birth control medication. These interactions may cause the birth control to be less effective at preventing pregnancy. There is also concern that hormonal birth control can increase HIV spreading to others, but more studies are needed to determine if this is true. The investigators did not know whether the NuvaRing and ARVs interact when they are used together, so this study looked to see if certain ARVs (efavirenz and atazanavir/ritonavir) interact with the two hormones released by NuvaRing. This will help us to determine if NuvaRing is safe and effective for women with HIV infection who are taking ARVs. The study also included HIV-infected women who were not on ARVs but used the NuvaRing to show us what the hormone levels are like in a similar group of women not on ARVs.

Vaginal rings are also currently being studied to deliver anti-HIV medications that may prevent HIV acquisition, and to provide birth control over a longer period of time (more than 1 month). Since vaginal rings will become more commonly used to administer medications, the investigators wanted to better understand the potential for drug interactions with drugs given vaginally. This study will also help us understand the potential for drug interactions between ARVs given orally, and other drugs given through vaginal rings, like the NuvaRing. Additionally, this study will help us understand how hormones released from a vaginal ring affect the amount of HIV virus in the genital tract, the bacterial make-up (microbiome) of the female genital tract, and the immune system within the genital tract, all of which may affect the chances of spreading HIV.","This was a 28 day study from study entry through the final clinic visit.

ECEPCs, obtained by immunoselection of CD14+ and CD34+ cells, or BM-MNCs, were injected intramuscularly in the affected limb of patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI).","Peripheral arterial disease comprises a clinical spectrum that extends from no symptoms to presentation with critical limb ischemia (CLI), which is a very invalidating condition characterized by rest pain, march inability, trophic lesions and unavoidable progression to major amputations, which are burdened by a high mortality in the first year. The pathophysiology of CLI often associates with a defect in the development of collateral vessels and angiogenesis, a process which refers to the formation of new blood vessels into tissue, due to circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and vascular progenitor cells. In the last few years, significant improvement of this condition has been reported following bone marrow (BM) autotransplant or autotransplant of peripheral EPCs mobilized from BM through the injection of granulocyte-colony stimulatory factor (G-CSF). In a previous study, the investigators found that individually variable proportions of circulating CD14+ cells expressed low levels of CD34 (CD14+CD34low) and revealed the functional phenotype of EPCs. The investigators therefore designed a monocentric randomized clinical trial to compare the therapeutic efficacy of BM autotransplant with the autotransplant of a population of circulating CD34+ and CD14+CD34low enriched by a closed sterile immunomagnetic system (enriched circulating EPCs or ECEPCs), without a previous EPC mobilization from BM.

Pharmacological group - Antidiarrheal drugs. Antidiarrheal microorganisms. Microorganisms that produce lactic acid.

The investigational probiotic medicine ""AS-Probionorm"" was created on the basis of an association of lactic acid bacteria with targeted action for oral use for the treatment of inflammatory and infectious diseases of the human gastrointestinal tract.

The first phase of a clinical trial is the first test of a medicine conducted on healthy volunteers to establish tolerability and safety.

According to the goal and objectives of the phase I clinical trial, the main parameter is to study the safety and tolerability of the medicine throughout the entire study period.

Phase I of the clinical trial of the medicine included 20 healthy subjects of both sexes aged 18-50 years. Clinical and laboratory parameters to characterize the safety of the medicine: medical history, physical examination, ECG, general and biochemical blood tests, urine and stool tests.

Selection and Exclusion of Subjects: Prior to inclusion in a clinical trial, each trial subject must first sign an Informed Consent Form for Participation in the Study, followed by a screening examination of each subject, including a variety of procedures, medical history, and physical examination. Each subject participating in the survey will be assigned an identification number.

Study design: open-label, single-center, phase I of clinical trial. Dosage regimen - 1 sachet (1 g) 2 times a day with an interval of 12 hours. The total duration of study subjects' participation in the study is 21 days. Tolerability of the study drug: Tolerability of the drug will be assessed based on subjective symptoms and sensations reported by patients and objective data obtained by the investigator during the study.

Pharmacological group - Antidiarrheal drugs. Antidiarrheal microorganisms. Microorganisms that produce lactic acid.

Introduction:

Acute intestinal infections (AII) are one of the pressing health problems in all countries. The complexity of their treatment is associated with the massive irrational use of antibiotics and chemotherapeutic drugs, which has led to the development of multidrug resistance in pathogens. Therefore, the modern strategy for the treatment of acute intestinal infections gives priority to therapeutic measures aimed at correcting intestinal microbiocenosis to eliminate the source of infection localized in the intestine.

The main idea is to conduct clinical studies of the domestic medicinal probiotic medicine ""AS-Probionorm"" based on the association of lactic acid bacteria of targeted action for oral use for the treatment of inflammatory and infectious diseases of the human gastrointestinal tract.

During preclinical trials, it was established that the drug exhibits high antimicrobial activity, therapeutic and prophylactic effectiveness, as well as safety during use.

The purpose of the study was to study the safety and tolerability of the study medicine ""AS-Probionorm"" in healthy study subjects.

Phase I of the clinical trial of the drug included 20 healthy subjects of both sexes aged 18-50 years. Clinical and laboratory parameters to characterize the safety of the drug: medical history, physical examination, ECG, general and biochemical blood tests, urine and stool tests.

Study design: open-label, single-center, phase I clinical trial. Dosage regimen: 1 sachet (1 g) 2 times a day with an interval of 12 hours. The study drug should be used 15-20 minutes before meals in the morning and evening. Before use, the medicine is mixed with 30-50 ml of boiled water at room temperature, resulting in a cream-colored suspension. The resulting water suspension should be drunk. The duration of taking is 7 days.

The study will be carried out on an outpatient basis. The total duration of study subjects' participation in the study is 21 days. On days 1, 8, 15, 21, a medical examination and laboratory tests will be carried out.

The duration of the study course of 21 days is determined by studying the possibility of developing local toxic and allergic reactions at the dosages recommended to identify the therapeutic effect.

Tolerability of the drug will be assessed based on subjective symptoms and sensations reported by patients and objective data obtained by the investigator during the study. The frequency of occurrence and nature of adverse reactions are also taken into account. The degree of tolerability of the study drug will be determined by three gradations: intolerance, absence of undesirable drug reactions (side reactions), undesirable drug reactions (side effects) not classified as serious.

Statistical analysis of data is carried out based on the results of collecting anamnestic, clinical data, as well as data from laboratory and instrumental studies. The volume of consultations, examinations and concomitant treatment carried out before the study is also recorded. Data collection will be carried out using an approved form - Individual Registration Card.

Gastric emptying may be normal, rapid or delayed in patients with obesity and be a factor in variable BE outcomes. Gastric myoelectrical activity (GMA) reflects gastric pacemaker activity which controls gastric contractions. The non-invasive electrogastrogram(EGG) uses standard electrodes positioned on the abdominal surface to record GMA. The investigators postulate that GMA patterns recorded with EGG will reflect subgroups in regards to stomach electrical physiology in obesity and that these subgroups will be useful in selecting patients for various BE procedures to maximize success of the procedures.","Electrogastrography is a non-invasive method of recording GMA that is used to diagnose gastric dysrythmias in patients with intractable chronic nausea and vomiting, gastroparesis and gastroesophageal reflux.

Bariatric Techniques: 3 categories 1)restrictive,2) mal absorptive 3)mixed Bariatric endoscopy techniques have emerged as safe and effective treatment that include restrictive endoscopic techniques: Intragastric balloons or endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty(ESG),primary surgery obesity endoluminal (POSE) or Endo-sleeve (GESP or POSE 2.0) procedures; malabsorptive techniques :endoluminal bypass (endobarrier),duodenal mucosa resurfacing; extraction methods (Aspire); electrical stimulation : gastric pacemaker, vagal blockage and other procedures.

Weight loss and long-term maintenance may be conditioned by changes in GMA, as well as by anatomical modifications induced by the bariatric procedure.

Since anatomical modifications of the stomach by the BE procedures are related to weight loss, The purpose is to determine whether different procedures to reduce gastric capacity will result in substantial changes in GMA and in the water load volume ingested. No studies that have studied obese population before and after such BE procedures are available.

Therefore, whether obese patients have the GMA that is similar to those with functional dyspepsia and normal weight . Also, the usefulness of electrogastrography as a new tool to customize choice of Bariatric therapies by determining success or failure based on GMA and WLST results has not been studied. GMA measures the normal or depleted gastric ICCs and the WLST measures gastric capacity, objective measures that may be important to predict success of Bariatric procedures and thus to help with patient selection to maximize efficacy and minimize side effects.

As these patients will all be on chronic opioid analgesics, the investigators will also assess the possible synergistic affect between inhaled cannabis and opioids. The investigators will also assess the clinical safety of the concomitant use of cannabinoids and these opioids in patients with SCD by monitoring the short-term side effects associated with combined therapy. Finally, the investigators will evaluate the short-term effects of inhaled cannabis on markers of inflammation and disease progression in patients with SCD.

Hypotheses are as follows:

1. Inhaled cannabis will significantly reduce chronic pain in patients with SCD.
2. Inhaled cannabis will significantly alter the short-term side effects experienced by patients who take opioids for SCD.
3. Inhaled cannabis will significantly alter markers of inflammation and disease progression in patients with SCD compared to placebo.","This is a proof-of-principle investigation of the safety and potential effectiveness of inhaled vaporized cannabis when added to a stable analgesic regimen in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients with chronic pain. The study will be comprised of two 5-day intervention periods in the inpatient setting (the Clinical Research Center at SFGH), with completion of a 5-day daily pain diary prior to admission to establish an outpatient baseline. Participants will be randomly assigned, in double-blind fashion, to treatment with (A) vaporized cannabis with an approximately 1:1 ration of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol:cannabidiol or (B) vaporized placebo. Those who receive treatment A during the first admission will receive treatment B in the second, and those who receive treatment B during the first admission will receive treatment A in the second.

Current methods of screening men for prostate cancer are inaccurate and cannot identify which men do not have prostate cancer or have low-grade cases that will not cause harm and which men have significant prostate cancer needing treatment. False-positive screening tests can result in unnecessary prostate biopsies for men who do not need them. However, new genetic testing might help identify which men are at highest risk for prostate cancer. This study will examine whether a genetic test helps identify men at risk for significant prostate cancer while helping men who are at low risk for prostate cancer avoid unnecessary biopsies. If this genetic test proves beneficial, it will improve the way that healthcare providers screen male Veterans for prostate cancer.","Prostate cancer is the most common non-cutaneous cancer in US men and in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA): 1 in 8 will be diagnosed with the disease in their lifetime. Many cases are non-lethal, but prostate cancer remains the 2nd leading cause of cancer death among US men, representing 2.5% of all deaths. VHA diagnoses \>16,000 new cases annually and cares for \>400,000 men living with prostate cancer. As a result, prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment is a national priority for VHA.

A major impediment to reducing the incidence of metastatic prostate cancer and prostate cancer death is the lack of an optimal screening strategy to identify men at high risk. Screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing modestly reduces prostate cancer deaths but at the cost of overdiagnoses and overtreatment. Current screening approaches do not adequately distinguish men without prostate cancer or with low-grade prostate cancer amenable to active surveillance from men with clinically significant prostate cancer, who need treatment. As a result, clinical guidelines do not recommend universal prostate cancer screening, including those from the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and the VHA National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention. Still, many men undergo screening based on variable and subjective assessments of their race/ethnicity, family history, and other risk factors.

A new paradigm of precision screening could improve the benefit-to-harm ratio of screening by implementing screening strategies tailored to an individual's specific genetic profile. Due to advances in high-throughput genotyping and sequencing, increasingly large and diverse cohort studies, and standardization of genetic variant classification, germline genetic testing is emerging as a powerful predictor for prostate cancer, including metastatic and lethal disease. This includes both rare highly penetrant variants and polygenic risk scores (PRS), which characterize an individual's predisposition to prostate cancer due to common genetic variation. Rare and common genetic variation is now an equally powerful predictor of clinically significant disease as self-reported race or family history, including in the Million Veteran Program.

This clinical trial will evaluate the promise of precision risk stratification to identify men most likely to benefit from prostate cancer screening. During the proof-of-concept phase, the investigators will achieve the following aims:

1. Develop a precision prostate cancer screening intervention consisting of genetic testing for rare variants and a transancestry PRS, delivered to participants and their primary care providers along with individualized, genetic risk-informed screening recommendations.
2. Determine the feasibility of enrolling men aged 55-70 ( 35% of whom are of racial/ethnic minority groups) to a pragmatic randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing the precision screening intervention to usual care.
3. Perform an interim assessment to determine whether the observed trajectory of negative prostate biopsy event rates is consistent with rates needed to detect a meaningful between-group difference at the end of the 7-year project period.

If the investigators demonstrate feasibility of enrollment and adequate event rates during the proof-of-concept phase, the RCT will continue to the clinical trial phase to test the following co-primary hypotheses:

1. Compared with men in the usual care arm, men in the precision screening arm will have a time-to-diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa, defined as NCCN classification intermediate risk or higher) that is not inferior by a margin of \>30 days over a median 4 years of follow-up.

   a. If non-inferiority is demonstrated, the investigators will sequentially test the hypothesis that time-to-diagnosis of csPCa is shorter in the precision screening arm than in the usual care arm (superiority).
2. Compared with usual care, men in the precision screening arm overall will undergo fewer negative prostate biopsies over a median 4 years of follow-up.

Pre-specified subgroup analyses will test these hypotheses in Black men specifically, to evaluate whether this population benefits equally or more from the intervention. Enrollees will be followed for additional outcomes including all prostate cancer diagnoses, PSA testing, prostate MRI, rare variants identified, preferences for or against prostate cancer screening, and health-related quality of life.

The investigators expect that precision screening will increase screening among high-risk patients but decrease screening among low- and average-risk patients, thereby maintaining or improving overall csPCa detection while improving the population-level benefit-to-harm ratio. Rigorous RCT evidence that genetic risk-informed screening maintains the benefits of screening while minimizing the harms of unnecessary procedures and treatments among low-risk men will change clinical practice and policy around prostate cancer screening.",VA Office of Research and Development,FED,SPONSOR,INTERVENTIONAL,,ESTIMATED,5000.0,RANDOMIZED,PARALLEL,"Enrolled participants will be randomly allocated to receive either the precision screening intervention or usual care.
